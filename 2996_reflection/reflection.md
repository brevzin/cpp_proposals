# Revision History

Since [@P2996R7]:

* changed reflection operator from `^` to `^^` following adoption of [@P3381R0]
* renamed `(u8)operator_symbol_of` to `(u8)symbol_of`
* renamed some `operators` (`exclaim` -> `exclamation_mark`, `three_way_comparison` -> `spaceship`, and `ampersand_and` -> `ampersand_ampersand`)
* renamed `define_class` to `define_aggregate`
* removed `define_static_array`, `define_static_string`, and `reflect_invoke`
* clarified that `sizeof(std::meta::info) == `sizeof(void *)`
* rename `data_member_options_t` to `data_member_options`, as per LEWG feedback
* clarified that `data_member_options` and `name_type` are non-structural consteval-only types
* clarified that everything in `std::meta` is addressable
* renaming `member_offsets` to `member_offset` and changing `member_offset` members to be `ptrdiff_t` instead of `size_t`, to allow for future use with negative offsets
* renamed the type traits from all being named `type_meow` to a more bespoke naming scheme.
* rewrote core wording for `$consteval-only type$` and for all splicers.
* changing signature of `reflect_value` to take a `T const&` instead of a `T`.

Since [@P2996R6]:

* removed the `accessible_members` family of functions
* added the `get_public` family of functions
* added missing `tuple` and `variant` traits
* added missing `is_mutable_member` function
* added `(u8)operator_symbol_of` functions, tweaked enumerator names in `std::meta::operators`

* several core wording fixes
* added `is_user_declared` for completeness with `is_user_provided`

Since [@P2996R5]:

* fixed broken "Emulating typeful reflection" example.
* removed linkage restrictions on objects of consteval-only type that were introduced in St. Louis.
* make friends with modules: define _injected declarations_ and _injected points_, as well as the _evaluation context_; modify _TU-local_ and related definitions, clarify behavior of `members_of` and `define_class`. An informal elaboration on this is included in a new section on "Reachability and injected declarations".

* more strongly specified comparison and linkage rules for reflections of aliases
* changed `is_noexcept` to apply to a wider class of entities
* reworked the API for reflecting on accessible class members
* renamed `test_type` and `test_types` to `test_trait`

Since [@P2996R2]:

* many wording changes, additions, and improvements
* elaborated on equivalence among reflections and linkage of templated entities specialized by reflections
* added `accessible_members_of` variants to restore a TS-era agreement
* renamed function previously called `value_of` to `extract`, and expanded it to operate on functions
* clarified support for reflections of values and objects rather than constant expressions
* added Godbolt links to Clang/P2996 implementation
* added `can_substitute`, `is_value`, `is_object`, and (new) `value_of`

* added an alternative [named tuple](#named-tuple) implementation
* made default/value/zero-initializing a `meta::info` yield a null reflection
* added addressed splicing, which is implemented but was omitted from the paper
* added another overload to `reflect_invoke` to support template arguments
* renamed all the type traits to start with `type_` to avoid name clashes. added more generalized `is_const`, `is_final`, and `is_volatile`
* added `is_noexcept` and fixed `is_explicit` to only apply to member functions, not member function templates
* added section on [handling text](#reflecting-source-text)
* added a section discussing ODR concerns

Since [@P2996R1], several changes to the overall library API:

* added `qualified_name_of` (to partner with `name_of`)
* removed `is_static` for being ambiguous, added `has_internal_linkage` (and `has_linkage` and `has_external_linkage`) and `is_static_member` instead

* added ticket counter and variant examples
* collapsed `entity_ref` and `pointer_to_member` into `value_of`

# Introduction

This is a proposal for a reduced initial set of features to support static reflection in C++.
Specifically, we are mostly proposing a subset of features suggested in [@P1240R2]:

  - the representation of program elements via constant-expressions producing
     _reflection values_ — _reflections_ for short — of an opaque type `std::meta::info`,
  - a _reflection operator_ (prefix `^^`) that computes a reflection value for its operand construct,
  - a number of `consteval` _metafunctions_ to work with reflections (including deriving other reflections), and
  - constructs called _splicers_ to produce grammatical elements from reflections (e.g., `[: $refl$ :]`).

(Note that this aims at something a little broader than pure "reflection".
 We not only want to observe the structure of the program: We also want to ease generating code that depends on those observations.
 That combination is sometimes referred to as "reflective metaprogramming", but within WG21 discussion the term "reflection" has often been used informally to refer to the same general idea.)

This proposal is not intended to be the end-game as far as reflection and compile-time
metaprogramming are concerned.  Instead, we expect it will be a useful core around which more
powerful features will be added incrementally over time.  In particular, we believe that most
or all the remaining features explored in P1240R2 and that code injection
(along the lines described in [@P2237R0]) are desirable directions to pursue.

Our choice to start with something smaller is primarily motivated by the belief that that
improves the chances of these facilities making it into the language sooner rather than
later.

## Notable Additions to P1240

While we tried to select a useful subset of the P1240 features, we also made a few additions and changes.
Most of those changes are minor.
For example, we added a `std::meta::test_trait` interface that makes it convenient to use existing standard type predicates (such as `is_class_v`) in reflection computations.

One addition does stand out, however: We have added metafunctions that permit the synthesis of simple struct and union types.
While it is not nearly as powerful as generalized code injection (see [@P2237R0]), it can be remarkably effective in practice.

## Why a single opaque reflection type?

Perhaps the most common suggestion made regarding the framework outlined in P1240 is to
switch from the single `std::meta::info` type to a family of types covering various
language elements (e.g., `std::meta::variable`, `std::meta::type`, etc.).

We believe that doing so would be a mistake with very serious consequences for the future of C++.

Specifically, it would codify the language design into the type system.  We know from
experience that it has been quasi-impossible to change the semantics of standard types once they
were standardized, and there is no reason to think that such evolution would become easier in
the future.  Suppose for example that we had standardized a reflection type `std::meta::variable`
in C++03 to represent what the standard called "variables" at the time.  In C++11, the term
"variable" was extended to include "references".  Such an change would have been difficult to
do given that C++ by then likely would have had plenty of code that depended on a type arrangement
around the more restricted definition of "variable".  That scenario is clearly backward-looking,
but there is no reason to believe that similar changes might not be wanted in the future and we
strongly believe that it behooves us to avoid adding undue constraints on the evolution of the
language.

Other advantages of a single opaque type include:

  - it makes no assumptions about the representation used within the implementation
    (e.g., it doesn't advantage one compiler over another),
  - it is trivially extensible (no types need to be added to represent additional
    language elements and meta-elements as the language evolves), and
  - it allows convenient collections of heterogeneous constructs without having
    to surface reference semantics (e.g., a `std::vector<std::meta::info>`
    can easily represent a mixed template argument list — containing types and
    nontypes — without fear of slicing values).


## Implementation Status

Lock3 implemented the equivalent of much that is proposed here in a fork of Clang (specifically, it worked with the P1240 proposal, but also included several other capabilities including a first-class injection mechanism).

EDG has an ongoing implementation of this proposal that is currently available on Compiler Explorer (thank you, Matt Godbolt).

Additionally, Bloomberg has open sourced a fork of Clang which provides a second implementation of this proposal, also available on Compiler Explorer (again thank you, Matt Godbolt), which can be found here: [https://github.com/bloomberg/clang-p2996](https://github.com/bloomberg/clang-p2996).

Neither implementation is complete, but all significant features proposed by this paper have been implemented by at least one implementation (including namespace and template splicers). Both implementations have their "quirks" and continue to evolve alongside this paper.

Nearly all of the examples below have links to Compiler Explorer demonstrating them in both EDG and Clang.

The implementations notably lack some of the other proposed language features that dovetail well with reflection; most notably, expansion statements are absent.
A workaround that will be used in the linked implementations of examples is the following facility:

::: std
```cpp
namespace __impl {
  template<auto... vals>
  struct replicator_type {
    template<typename F>
      constexpr void operator>>(F body) const {
        (body.template operator()<vals>(), ...);
      }
  };

  template<auto... vals>
  replicator_type<vals...> replicator = {};
}

template<typename R>
consteval auto expand(R range) {
  std::vector<std::meta::info> args;
  for (auto r : range) {
    args.push_back(reflect_value(r));
  }
  return substitute(^^__impl::replicator, args);
}
```

:::

Used like:

::: cmptable
### With expansion statements
```cpp
template <typename E>
  requires std::is_enum_v<E>
constexpr std::string enum_to_string(E value) {
  template for (constexpr auto e : std::meta::enumerators_of(^^E)) {
    if (value == [:e:]) {
      return std::string(std::meta::identifier_of(e));
    }
  }

  return "<unnamed>";
}
```

### With `expand` workaround
```cpp
template<typename E>
  requires std::is_enum_v<E>
constexpr std::string enum_to_string(E value) {
  std::string result = "<unnamed>";
  [:expand(std::meta::enumerators_of(^^E)):] >> [&]<auto e>{
    if (value == [:e:]) {
      result = std::meta::identifier_of(e);
    }
  };
  return result;
}
```

# Examples

We start with a number of examples that show off what is possible with the proposed set of features.
It is expected that these are mostly self-explanatory.
Read ahead to the next sections for a more systematic description of each element of this proposal.

A number of our examples here show a few other language features that we hope to progress at the same time. This facility does not strictly rely on these features, and it is possible to do without them - but it would greatly help the usability experience if those could be adopted as well:

* expansion statements [@P1306R2]
* non-transient constexpr allocation [@P0784R7] [@P1974R0] [@P2670R1]

## Back-And-Forth

Our first example is not meant to be compelling but to show how to go back and forth between the reflection domain and the grammatical domain:

::: std
```c++
constexpr auto r = ^^int;
typename[:r:] x = 42;       // Same as: int x = 42;
typename[:^^char:] c = '*';  // Same as: char c = '*';
```
:::

The `typename` prefix can be omitted in the same contexts as with dependent qualified names (i.e., in what the standard calls _type-only contexts_).
For example:

::: std
```c++
using MyType = [:sizeof(int)<sizeof(long)? ^^long : ^^int:];  // Implicit "typename" prefix.
```

## Selecting Members

Our second example enables selecting a member "by number" for a specific type:

::: std
```c++
struct S { unsigned i:2, j:6; };

consteval auto member_number(int n) {
  if (n == 0) return ^^S::i;
  else if (n == 1) return ^^S::j;
}

int main() {
  S s{0, 0};
  s.[:member_number(1):] = 42;  // Same as: s.j = 42;
  s.[:member_number(5):] = 0;   // Error (member_number(5) is not a constant).
}
```
:::

This example also illustrates that bit fields are not beyond the reach of this proposal.

On Compiler Explorer: [EDG](https://godbolt.org/z/cKaK4v8nr), [Clang](https://godbolt.org/z/Tb57jEn8a).

Note that a "member access splice" like `s.[:member_number(1):]` is a more direct member access mechanism than the traditional syntax.
It doesn't involve member name lookup, access checking, or --- if the spliced reflection value represents a member function --- overload resolution.

This proposal includes a number of consteval "metafunctions" that enable the introspection of various language constructs.
Among those metafunctions is `std::meta::nonstatic_data_members_of` which returns a vector of reflection values that describe the non-static members of a given type.
We could thus rewrite the above example as:

::: std
```c++
struct S { unsigned i:2, j:6; };

consteval auto member_number(int n) {
  return std::meta::nonstatic_data_members_of(^^S)[n];
}

int main() {
  S s{0, 0};
  s.[:member_number(1):] = 42;  // Same as: s.j = 42;
  s.[:member_number(5):] = 0;   // Error (member_number(5) is not a constant).
}
```
:::

On Compiler Explorer: [EDG](https://godbolt.org/z/7P3ax5K16), [Clang](https://godbolt.org/z/q158vdbaz).

This proposal specifies that namespace `std::meta` is associated with the reflection type (`std::meta::info`); the `std::meta::` qualification can therefore be omitted in the example above.

Another frequently-useful metafunction is `std::meta::identifier_of`, which returns a `std::string_view` describing the identifier with which an entity represented by a given reflection value was declared.
With such a facility, we could conceivably access non-static data members "by string":

::: std
```c++
struct S { unsigned i:2, j:6; };

consteval auto member_named(std::string_view name) {
  for (std::meta::info field : nonstatic_data_members_of(^^S)) {
    if (has_identifier(field) && identifier_of(field) == name)
      return field;
  }
}

int main() {
  S s{0, 0};
  s.[:member_named("j"):] = 42;  // Same as: s.j = 42;
  s.[:member_named("x"):] = 0;   // Error (member_named("x") is not a constant).
}
```

## List of Types to List of Sizes

Here, `sizes` will be a `std::array<std::size_t, 3>` initialized with `{sizeof(int), sizeof(float), sizeof(double)}`:

::: std
```c++
constexpr std::array types = {^^int, ^^float, ^^double};
constexpr std::array sizes = []{
  std::array<std::size_t, types.size()> r;
  std::views::transform(types, r.begin(), std::meta::size_of);
  return r;
}();
```
:::

Compare this to the following type-based approach, which produces the same array `sizes`:

::: std
```c++
template<class...> struct list {};

using types = list<int, float, double>;

constexpr auto sizes = []<template<class...> class L, class... T>(L<T...>) {
    return std::array<std::size_t, sizeof...(T)>{{ sizeof(T)... }};
}(types{});
```
:::

## Implementing `make_integer_sequence`

We can provide a better implementation of `make_integer_sequence` than a hand-rolled approach using regular template metaprogramming (although standard libraries today rely on an intrinsic for this):

::: std
```c++
#include <utility>
#include <vector>

template<typename T>
consteval std::meta::info make_integer_seq_refl(T N) {
  std::vector args{^^T};
  for (T k = 0; k < N; ++k) {
    args.push_back(std::meta::reflect_value(k));
  }
  return substitute(^^std::integer_sequence, args);
}

template<typename T, T N>
  using make_integer_sequence = [:make_integer_seq_refl<T>(N):];
```
:::

On Compiler Explorer: [EDG](https://godbolt.org/z/G3TM9Tbad), [Clang](https://godbolt.org/z/57bcYqbv8).

Note that the memoization implicit in the template substitution process still applies.
So having multiple uses of, e.g., `make_integer_sequence<int, 20>` will only involve one evaluation of `make_integer_seq_refl<int>(20)`.


## Getting Class Layout

::: std
```c++
struct member_descriptor
{
  std::size_t offset;
  std::size_t size;
};

// returns std::array<member_descriptor, N>
template <typename S>
consteval auto get_layout() {
  constexpr auto members = nonstatic_data_members_of(^^S);
  std::array<member_descriptor, members.size()> layout;
  for (int i = 0; i < members.size(); ++i) {
      layout[i] = {.offset=offset_of(members[i]).bytes, .size=size_of(members[i])};
  }
  return layout;
}

struct X
{
    char a;
    int b;
    double c;
};

/*constexpr*/ auto Xd = get_layout<X>();

/*
where Xd would be std::array<member_descriptor, 3>{@{@
  { 0, 1 }, { 4, 4 }, { 8, 8 }
}}
*/
```

## Enum to String

One of the most commonly requested facilities is to convert an enum value to a string (this example relies on expansion statements):

::: std
```c++
template <typename E>
  requires std::is_enum_v<E>
constexpr std::string enum_to_string(E value) {
  template for (constexpr auto e : std::meta::enumerators_of(^^E)) {
    if (value == [:e:]) {
      return std::string(std::meta::identifier_of(e));
    }
  }

  return "<unnamed>";
}

enum Color { red, green, blue };
static_assert(enum_to_string(Color::red) == "red");
static_assert(enum_to_string(Color(42)) == "<unnamed>");
```
:::

We can also do the reverse in pretty much the same way:

::: std
```c++
template <typename E>
  requires std::is_enum_v<E>
constexpr std::optional<E> string_to_enum(std::string_view name) {
  template for (constexpr auto e : std::meta::enumerators_of(^^E)) {
    if (name == std::meta::identifier_of(e)) {
      return [:e:];
    }
  }

  return std::nullopt;
}
```
:::

But we don't have to use expansion statements - we can also use algorithms. For instance, `enum_to_string` can also be implemented this way (this example relies on non-transient constexpr allocation), which also demonstrates choosing a different algorithm based on the number of enumerators:

::: std
```c++
template <typename E>
  requires std::is_enum_v<E>
constexpr std::string enum_to_string(E value) {
  constexpr auto get_pairs = []{
    return std::meta::enumerators_of(^^E)
      | std::views::transform([](std::meta::info e){
          return std::pair<E, std::string>(std::meta::extract<E>(e), std::meta::identifier_of(e));
        })
  };

  constexpr auto get_name = [](E value) -> std::optional<std::string> {
    if constexpr (enumerators_of(^^E).size() <= 7) {
      // if there aren't many enumerators, use a vector with find_if()
      constexpr auto enumerators = get_pairs() | std::ranges::to<std::vector>();
      auto it = std::ranges::find_if(enumerators, [value](auto const& pr){
        return pr.first == value;
      });
      if (it == enumerators.end()) {
        return std::nullopt;
      } else {
        return it->second;
      }
    } else {
      // if there are lots of enumerators, use a map with find()
      constexpr auto enumerators = get_pairs() | std::ranges::to<std::map>();
      auto it = enumerators.find(value);
      if (it == enumerators.end()) {
        return std::nullopt;
      } else {
        return it->second;
      }
    }
  };

  return get_name(value).value_or("<unnamed>");
}
```
:::

Note that this last version has lower complexity: While the versions using an expansion statement use an expected O(N) number of comparisons to find the matching entry, a `std::map` achieves the same with O(log(N)) complexity (where N is the number of enumerator constants).

On Compiler Explorer: [EDG](https://godbolt.org/z/hf777PfGo), [Clang](https://godbolt.org/z/h5rTnWrKW).


Many many variations of these functions are possible and beneficial depending on the needs of the client code.
For example:

  - the "\<unnamed>" case could instead output a valid cast expression like "E(5)"
  - a more sophisticated lookup algorithm could be selected at compile time depending on the length of `enumerators_of(^^E)`
  - a compact two-way persistent data structure could be generated to support both `enum_to_string` and `string_to_enum` with a minimal footprint
  - etc.


## Parsing Command-Line Options

Our next example shows how a command-line option parser could work by automatically inferring flags based on member names. A real command-line parser would of course be more complex, this is just the beginning.

::: std
```c++
template<typename Opts>
auto parse_options(std::span<std::string_view const> args) -> Opts {
  Opts opts;
  template for (constexpr auto dm : nonstatic_data_members_of(^^Opts)) {
    auto it = std::ranges::find_if(args,
      [](std::string_view arg){
        return arg.starts_with("--") && arg.substr(2) == identifier_of(dm);
      });

    if (it == args.end()) {
      // no option provided, use default
      continue;
    } else if (it + 1 == args.end()) {
      std::print(stderr, "Option {} is missing a value\n", *it);
      std::exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    using T = typename[:type_of(dm):];
    auto iss = std::ispanstream(it[1]);
    if (iss >> opts.[:dm:]; !iss) {
      std::print(stderr, "Failed to parse option {} into a {}\n", *it, display_string_of(^^T));
      std::exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
  }
  return opts;
}

struct MyOpts {
  std::string file_name = "input.txt";  // Option "--file_name <string>"
  int    count = 1;                     // Option "--count <int>"

## A Simple Tuple Type

::: std
```c++
#include <meta>

template<typename... Ts> struct Tuple {
  struct storage;

  static_assert(is_type(define_aggregate(^^storage, {data_member_spec(^^Ts)...})));
  storage data;

  Tuple(): data{} {}
  Tuple(Ts const& ...vs): data{ vs... } {}
};

template<typename... Ts>
  struct std::tuple_size<Tuple<Ts...>>: public integral_constant<size_t, sizeof...(Ts)> {};

template<std::size_t I, typename... Ts>
  struct std::tuple_element<I, Tuple<Ts...>> {
    static constexpr std::array types = {^^Ts...};
    using type = [: types[I] :];
  };

consteval std::meta::info get_nth_field(std::meta::info r, std::size_t n) {
  return nonstatic_data_members_of(r)[n];
}

template<std::size_t I, typename... Ts>
  constexpr auto get(Tuple<Ts...> &t) noexcept -> std::tuple_element_t<I, Tuple<Ts...>>& {
    return t.data.[:get_nth_field(^^decltype(t.data), I):];
  }
// Similarly for other value categories...
```
:::

This example uses a "magic" `std::meta::define_aggregate` template along with member reflection through the `nonstatic_data_members_of` metafunction to implement a `std::tuple`-like type without the usual complex and costly template metaprogramming tricks that that involves when these facilities are not available.
`define_aggregate` takes a reflection for an incomplete class or union plus a vector of non-static data member descriptions, and completes the give class or union type to have the described members.

On Compiler Explorer: [EDG](https://godbolt.org/z/76EojjcEe), [Clang](https://godbolt.org/z/WvPzE677q).

## A Simple Variant Type

Similarly to how we can implement a tuple using `define_aggregate` to create on the fly a type with one member for each `Ts...`, we can implement a variant that simply defines a `union` instead of a `struct`.
One difference here is how the destructor of a `union` is currently defined:

::: std
```cpp
union U1 {
  int i;
  char c;
};

union U2 {
  int i;
  std::string s;
};
```
:::

`U1` has a trivial destructor, but `U2`'s destructor is defined as deleted (because `std::string` has a non-trivial destructor).
This is a problem because we need to define this thing... somehow.
However, for the purposes of `define_aggregate`, there really is only one reasonable option to choose here:

::: std
```cpp
template <class... Ts>
union U {
  // all of our members
  Ts... members;

  // a defaulted destructor if all of the types are trivially destructible
  constexpr ~U() requires (std::is_trivially_destructible_v<Ts> && ...) = default;

  // ... otherwise a destructor that does nothing
  constexpr ~U() { }
};
```
:::

If we make [`define_aggregate`](#data_member_spec-define_aggregate) for a `union` have this behavior, then we can implement a `variant` in a much more straightforward way than in current implementations.
This is not a complete implementation of `std::variant` (and cheats using libstdc++ internals, and also uses Boost.Mp11's `mp_with_index`) but should demonstrate the idea:

::: std
```cpp
template <typename... Ts>
class Variant {
    union Storage;
    struct Empty { };

    static_assert(is_type(define_aggregate(^^Storage, {
        data_member_spec(^^Empty, {.name="empty"}),
        data_member_spec(^^Ts)...
    })));

    static consteval std::meta::info get_nth_field(std::size_t n) {
        return nonstatic_data_members_of(^^Storage)[n+1];
    }

    Storage storage_;
    int index_ = -1;

    // cheat: use libstdc++'s implementation
    template <typename T>
    static constexpr size_t accepted_index = std::__detail::__variant::__accepted_index<T, std::variant<Ts...>>;

    template <class F>
    constexpr auto with_index(F&& f) const -> decltype(auto) {
        return mp_with_index<sizeof...(Ts)>(index_, (F&&)f);
    }

public:
    constexpr Variant() requires std::is_default_constructible_v<Ts...[0]>
        // should this work: storage_{. [: get_nth_field(0) :]{} }
        : storage_{.empty={}}
        , index_(0)
    {
        std::construct_at(&storage_.[: get_nth_field(0) :]);
    }

    constexpr ~Variant() requires (std::is_trivially_destructible_v<Ts> and ...) = default;
    constexpr ~Variant() {
        if (index_ != -1) {
            with_index([&](auto I){
                std::destroy_at(&storage_.[: get_nth_field(I) :]);
            });
        }
    }

    template <typename T, size_t I = accepted_index<T&&>>
        requires (!std::is_base_of_v<Variant, std::decay_t<T>>)
    constexpr Variant(T&& t)
        : storage_{.empty={}}
        , index_(-1)
    {
        std::construct_at(&storage_.[: get_nth_field(I) :], (T&&)t);
        index_ = (int)I;
    }

    // you can't actually express this constraint nicely until P2963
    constexpr Variant(Variant const&) requires (std::is_trivially_copyable_v<Ts> and ...) = default;
    constexpr Variant(Variant const& rhs)
            requires ((std::is_copy_constructible_v<Ts> and ...)
                and not (std::is_trivially_copyable_v<Ts> and ...))
        : storage_{.empty={}}
        , index_(-1)
    {
        rhs.with_index([&](auto I){
            constexpr auto field = get_nth_field(I);
            std::construct_at(&storage_.[: field :], rhs.storage_.[: field :]);
            index_ = I;
        });
    }

    constexpr auto index() const -> int { return index_; }

    template <class F>
    constexpr auto visit(F&& f) const -> decltype(auto) {
        if (index_ == -1) {
            throw std::bad_variant_access();
        }

        return mp_with_index<sizeof...(Ts)>(index_, [&](auto I) -> decltype(auto) {
            return std::invoke((F&&)f,  storage_.[: get_nth_field(I) :]);
        });
    }
};
```
:::

Effectively, `Variant<T, U>` synthesizes a union type `Storage` which looks like this:

::: std
```cpp
union Storage {
    Empty empty;
    T @*unnamed~0~*@;
    U @*unnamed~1~*@;

    ~Storage() requires std::is_trivially_destructible_v<T> && std::is_trivially_destructible_v<U> = default;
    ~Storage() { }
}
```
:::

The question here is whether we should be should be able to directly initialize members of a defined union using a splicer, as in:

::: std
```cpp
: storage{.[: get_nth_field(0) :]={}}
```
:::

Arguably, the answer should be yes - this would be consistent with how other accesses work. This is instead proposed in [@P3293R1].

## Struct to Struct of Arrays

::: std
```c++
#include <meta>
#include <array>

template <typename T, size_t N>
struct struct_of_arrays_impl {
  struct impl;

  consteval {
    std::vector<std::meta::info> old_members = nonstatic_data_members_of(^^T);
    std::vector<std::meta::info> new_members = {};
    for (std::meta::info member : old_members) {
        auto array_type = substitute(^^std::array, {
            type_of(member),
            std::meta::reflect_value(N),
        });
        auto mem_descr = data_member_spec(array_type, {.name = identifier_of(member)});
        new_members.push_back(mem_descr);
    }

    define_aggregate(^^impl, new_members);
  }
};

template <typename T, size_t N>
using struct_of_arrays = struct_of_arrays_impl<T, N>::impl;
```
:::

Example:

::: std
```c++
struct point {
  float x;
  float y;
  float z;
};

using points = struct_of_arrays<point, 30>;
// equivalent to:
// struct points {
//   std::array<float, 30> x;
//   std::array<float, 30> y;
//   std::array<float, 30> z;
// };
```
:::

Again, the combination of `nonstatic_data_members_of` and `define_aggregate` is put to good use.

## Parsing Command-Line Options II

Now that we've seen a couple examples of using `std::meta::define_aggregate` to create a type, we can create a more sophisticated command-line parser example.

This is the opening example for [clap](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/) (Rust's **C**ommand **L**ine **A**rgument **P**arser):

::: std
```c++
struct Args : Clap {
  Option<std::string, {.use_short=true, .use_long=true}> name;
  Option<int, {.use_short=true, .use_long=true}> count = 1;
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  auto opts = Args{}.parse(argc, argv);

  for (int i = 0; i < opts.count; ++i) {  // opts.count has type int
    std::print("Hello {}!", opts.name);   // opts.name has type std::string
  }
}
```
:::

Which we can implement like this:

::: std
```c++
struct Flags {
  bool use_short;
  bool use_long;
};

template <typename T, Flags flags>
struct Option {
  std::optional<T> initializer = {};

  // some suitable constructors and accessors for flags
};

// convert a type (all of whose non-static data members are specializations of Option)
// to a type that is just the appropriate members.
// For example, if type is a reflection of the Args presented above, then this
// function would evaluate to a reflection of the type
// struct {
//   std::string name;
//   int count;
// }
consteval auto spec_to_opts(std::meta::info opts,
                            std::meta::info spec) -> std::meta::info {
  std::vector<std::meta::info> new_members;
  for (std::meta::info member : nonstatic_data_members_of(spec)) {
    auto type_new = template_arguments_of(type_of(member))[0];
    new_members.push_back(data_member_spec(type_new, {.name=identifier_of(member)}));
  }
  return define_aggregate(opts, new_members);
}

struct Clap {
  template <typename Spec>
  auto parse(this Spec const& spec, int argc, char** argv) {
    std::vector<std::string_view> cmdline(argv+1, argv+argc)

    // check if cmdline contains --help, etc.

    struct Opts;
    static_assert(is_type(spec_to_opts(^^Opts, ^^Spec)));
    Opts opts;

    template for (constexpr auto [sm, om] : std::views::zip(nonstatic_data_members_of(^^Spec),
                                                            nonstatic_data_members_of(^^Opts))) {
      auto const& cur = spec.[:sm:];
      constexpr auto type = type_of(om);

      // find the argument associated with this option
      auto it = std::ranges::find_if(cmdline,
        [&](std::string_view arg){
          return (cur.use_short && arg.size() == 2 && arg[0] == '-' && arg[1] == identifier_of(sm)[0])
              || (cur.use_long && arg.starts_with("--") && arg.substr(2) == identifier_of(sm));
        });

      // no such argument
      if (it == cmdline.end()) {
        if constexpr (has_template_arguments(type) and template_of(type) == ^^std::optional) {
          // the type is optional, so the argument is too
          continue;
        } else if (cur.initializer) {
          // the type isn't optional, but an initializer is provided, use that
          opts.[:om:] = *cur.initializer;
          continue;
        } else {
          std::print(stderr, "Missing required option {}\n", display_string_of(sm));
          std::exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
      } else if (it + 1 == cmdline.end()) {
        std::print(stderr, "Option {} for {} is missing a value\n", *it, display_string_of(sm));
        std::exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }

      // found our argument, try to parse it
      auto iss = ispanstream(it[1]);
      if (iss >> opts.[:om:]; !iss) {
        std::print(stderr, "Failed to parse {:?} into option {} of type {}\n",
          it[1], display_string_of(sm), display_string_of(type));
        std::exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }
    }
    return opts;
  }
};

## A Universal Formatter

This example is taken from Boost.Describe:

::: std
```cpp
struct universal_formatter {
  constexpr auto parse(auto& ctx) { return ctx.begin(); }

  template <typename T>
  auto format(T const& t, auto& ctx) const {
    auto out = std::format_to(ctx.out(), "{}@{@{", has_identifier(^^T) ? identifier_of(^^T)
                                                                      : "(unnamed-type)";);

    auto delim = [first=true]() mutable {
      if (!first) {
        *out++ = ',';
        *out++ = ' ';
      }
      first = false;
    };

    template for (constexpr auto base : bases_of(^^T)) {
      delim();
      out = std::format_to(out, "{}", (typename [: type_of(base) :] const&)(t));
    }

    template for (constexpr auto mem : nonstatic_data_members_of(^^T)) {
      delim();
      std::string_view mem_label = has_identifier(mem) ? identifier_of(mem)
                                                       : "(unnamed-member)";
      out = std::format_to(out, ".{}={}", mem_label, t.[:mem:]);
    }

    *out++ = '}';
    return out;
  }
};

struct B { int m0 = 0; };
struct X { int m1 = 1; };
struct Y { int m2 = 2; };
class Z : public X, private Y { int m3 = 3; int m4 = 4; };

template <> struct std::formatter<B> : universal_formatter { };
template <> struct std::formatter<X> : universal_formatter { };
template <> struct std::formatter<Y> : universal_formatter { };
template <> struct std::formatter<Z> : universal_formatter { };

int main() {
    std::println("{}", Z());
      // Z{X{B{.m0=0}, .m1 = 1}, Y{{.m0=0}, .m2 = 2}, .m3 = 3, .m4 = 4}
}
```

Note that currently, we do not have the ability to access a base class subobject using the `t.[: base :]` syntax - which means that the only way to get at the base is to use a cast:

*  `static_cast<[: type_of(base) const& :]>(t)`, or
*  `(typename [: type_of(base) :] const&)t`

Both have to explicitly specify the `const`-ness of the type in the cast. The `static_cast` additionally has to check access. The C-style cast is one many people find unsavory, though in this case it avoids checking access - but requires writing `typename` since this isn't a type-only context.

## Implementing member-wise `hash_append`

Based on the [@N3980] API:

::: std
```cpp
template <typename H, typename T> requires std::is_standard_layout_v<T>
void hash_append(H& algo, T const& t) {
  template for (constexpr auto mem : nonstatic_data_members_of(^^T)) {
      hash_append(algo, t.[:mem:]);
  }
}
```
:::

## Converting a Struct to a Tuple

This approach requires allowing packs in structured bindings [@P1061R5], but can also be written using `std::make_index_sequence`:

::: std
```c++
template <typename T>
constexpr auto struct_to_tuple(T const& t) {
  constexpr auto members = nonstatic_data_members_of(^^T);

  constexpr auto indices = []{
    std::array<int, members.size()> indices;
    std::ranges::iota(indices, 0);
    return indices;
  }();

  constexpr auto [...Is] = indices;
  return std::make_tuple(t.[: members[Is] :]...);
}
```
:::

An alternative approach is:

::: std
```cpp
consteval auto type_struct_to_tuple(info type) -> info {
  return substitute(^^std::tuple,
                    nonstatic_data_members_of(type)
                    | std::views::transform(std::meta::type_of)
                    | std::views::transform(std::meta::remove_cvref)
                    | std::ranges::to<std::vector>());
}

template <typename To, typename From, std::meta::info ... members>
constexpr auto struct_to_tuple_helper(From const& from) -> To {
  return To(from.[:members:]...);
}

template<typename From>
consteval auto get_struct_to_tuple_helper() {
  using To = [: type_struct_to_tuple(^^From): ];

  std::vector args = {^^To, ^^From};
  for (auto mem : nonstatic_data_members_of(^^From)) {
    args.push_back(reflect_value(mem));
  }

  /*
  Alternatively, with Ranges:
  args.append_range(
    nonstatic_data_members_of(^^From)
    | std::views::transform(std::meta::reflect_value)
    );
  */

  return extract<To(*)(From const&)>(
    substitute(^^struct_to_tuple_helper, args));
}

template <typename From>
constexpr auto struct_to_tuple(From const& from) {
  return get_struct_to_tuple_helper<From>()(from);
}
```
:::

Here, `type_struct_to_tuple` takes a reflection of a type like `struct { T t; U const& u; V v; }` and returns a reflection of the type `std::tuple<T, U, V>`.
That gives us the return type.
Then, `struct_to_tuple_helper` is a function template that does the actual conversion --- which it can do by having all the reflections of the members as a non-type template parameter pack.
This is a `constexpr` function and not a `consteval` function because in the general case the conversion is a run-time operation.
However, determining the instance of `struct_to_tuple_helper` that is needed is a compile-time operation and has to be performed with a `consteval` function (because the function invokes `nonstatic_data_members_of`), hence the separate function template `get_struct_to_tuple_helper()`.

Everything is put together by using `substitute` to create the instantiation of `struct_to_tuple_helper` that we need, and a compile-time reference to that instance is obtained with `extract`.
Thus `f` is a function reference to the correct specialization of `struct_to_tuple_helper`, which we can simply invoke.

## Named Tuple

The tricky thing with implementing a named tuple is actually strings as non-type template parameters.
Because you cannot just pass `"x"` into a non-type template parameter of the form `auto V`, that leaves us with two ways of specifying the constituents:

1. Can introduce a `pair` type so that we can write `make_named_tuple<pair<int, "x">, pair<double, "y">>()`, or
2. Can just do reflections all the way down so that we can write
```cpp
make_named_tuple<^^int, std::meta::reflect_value("x"),
                 ^^double, std::meta::reflect_value("y")>()
```

We do not currently support splicing string literals, and the `pair` approach follows the similar pattern already shown with `define_aggregate` (given a suitable `fixed_string` type):

::: std
```cpp
template <class T, fixed_string Name>
struct pair {
    static constexpr auto name() -> std::string_view { return Name.view(); }
    using type = T;
};

template <class... Tags>
consteval auto make_named_tuple(std::meta::info type, Tags... tags) {
    std::vector<std::meta::info> nsdms;
    auto f = [&]<class Tag>(Tag tag){
        nsdms.push_back(data_member_spec(
            dealias(^^typename Tag::type),
            {.name=Tag::name()}));

    };
    (f(tags), ...);
    return define_aggregate(type, nsdms);
}

struct R;
static_assert(is_type(make_named_tuple(^^R, pair<int, "x">{}, pair<double, "y">{})));

static_assert(type_of(nonstatic_data_members_of(^^R)[0]) == ^^int);
static_assert(type_of(nonstatic_data_members_of(^^R)[1]) == ^^double);

int main() {
    [[maybe_unused]] auto r = R{.x=1, .y=2.0};
}
```

Alternatively, can side-step the question of non-type template parameters entirely by keeping everything in the value domain:

::: std
```cpp
consteval auto make_named_tuple(std::meta::info type,

## Compile-Time Ticket Counter

The features proposed here make it a little easier to update a ticket counter at compile time.
This is not an ideal implementation (we'd prefer direct support for compile-time —-- i.e., `consteval` --- variables), but it shows how compile-time mutable state surfaces in new ways.

::: std
```cpp
class TU_Ticket {
  template<int N> struct Helper;
public:
  static consteval int next() {
    int k = 0;

    // Search for the next incomplete 'Helper<k>'.
    std::meta::info r;
    while (is_complete_type(r = substitute(^^Helper,
                                           { std::meta::reflect_value(k) })))
      ++k;

    // Define 'Helper<k>' and return its index.
    define_aggregate(r, {});
    return k;
  }
};

constexpr int x = TU_Ticket::next();
static_assert(x == 0);

constexpr int y = TU_Ticket::next();
static_assert(y == 1);

constexpr int z = TU_Ticket::next();

# Proposed Features

## The Reflection Operator (`^^`)

The reflection operator produces a reflection value from a grammatical construct (its operand):

> | `$unary-expression$`:
> |       ...
> |       `^^` `::`
> |       `^^` `$namespace-name$`
> |       `^^` `$type-id$`
> |       `^^` `$id-expression$`

The expression `^^::` evaluates to a reflection of the global namespace. When the operand is a `$namespace-name$` or `$type-id$`, the resulting value is a reflection of the designated namespace or type.

When the operand is an `$id-expression$`, the resulting value is a reflection of the designated entity found by lookup. This might be any of:

- a variable, static data member, or structured binding
- a function or member function
- a non-static data member
- a primary template or primary member template
- an enumerator

For all other operands, the expression is ill-formed. In a SFINAE context, a failure to substitute the operand of a reflection operator construct causes that construct to not evaluate to constant.

Earlier revisions of this paper allowed for taking the reflection of any `$cast-expression$` that could be evaluated as a constant expression, as we believed that a constant expression could be internally "represented" by just capturing the value to which it evaluated. However, the possibility of side effects from constant evaluation (introduced by this very paper) renders this approach infeasible: even a constant expression would have to be evaluated every time it's spliced. It was ultimately decided to defer all support for expression reflection, but we intend to introduce it through a future paper using the syntax `^^(expr)`.

This paper does, however, support reflections of _values_ and of _objects_ (including subobjects). Such reflections arise naturally when iterating over template arguments.

```cpp
template <int P1, const int &P2> void fn() {}

static constexpr int p[2] = {1, 2};
constexpr auto spec = ^^fn<p[0], p[1]>;

static_assert(is_value(template_arguments_of(spec)[0]));
static_assert(is_object(template_arguments_of(spec)[1]));
static_assert(!is_variable(template_arguments_of(spec)[1]));

static_assert([:template_arguments_of(spec)[0]:] == 1);
static_assert(&[:template_arguments_of(spec)[1]:] == &p[1]);
```

Such reflections cannot generally be obtained using the `^^`-operator, but the `std::meta::reflect_value` and `std::meta::reflect_object` functions make it easy to reflect particular values or objects. The `std::meta::value_of` metafunction can also be used to map a reflection of an object to a reflection of its value.

### Syntax discussion

The original TS landed on `@[reflexpr]{.cf}@(...)` as the syntax to reflect source constructs and [@P1240R0] adopted that syntax as well.
As more examples were discussed, it became clear that that syntax was both (a) too "heavy" and (b) insufficiently distinct from a function call.
SG7 eventually agreed upon the prefix `^` operator. The "upward arrow" interpretation of the caret matches the "lift" or "raise" verbs that are sometimes used to describe the reflection operation in other contexts.

The caret already has a meaning as a binary operator in C++ ("exclusive OR"), but that is clearly not conflicting with a prefix operator.
In C++/CLI (a Microsoft C++ dialect) the caret is also used as a new kind of `$ptr-operator$` ([dcl.decl.general]{.sref}) to declare ["handles"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/extensions/handle-to-object-operator-hat-cpp-component-extensions?view=msvc-170).
That is also not conflicting with the use of the caret as a unary operator because C++/CLI uses the usual prefix `*` operator to dereference handles.

Apple also uses the caret in [syntax "blocks"](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithBlocks/WorkingwithBlocks.html) and unfortunately we believe that does conflict with our proposed use of the caret.

Since the syntax discussions in SG7 landed on the use of the caret, new basic source characters have become available: `@`, `` ` ``{.op}, and `$`{.op}. While we have since discussed some alternatives (e.g., `@` for lifting, `\` and `/` for "raising" and "lowering"), we have grown quite fond of the existing syntax.

In Wrocław 2024, SG7 and EWG voted to adopt `^^` as the new reflection operator (as proposed by [@P3381R0]). The R8 revision of this paper integrates that change.


## Splicers (`[:`...`:]`)

A reflection can be "spliced" into source code using one of several _splicer_ forms:

 - `[: r :]` produces an _expression_ evaluating to the entity represented by `r` in grammatical contexts that permit expressions.  In type-only contexts ([temp.res.general]{.sref}/4), `[: r :]` produces a type (and `r` must be the reflection of a type). In contexts that only permit a namespace name, `[: r :]` produces a namespace (and `r` must be the reflection of a namespace or alias thereof).
 - `typename[: r :]` produces a _simple-type-specifier_ corresponding to the type represented by `r`.
 - `template[: r :]` produces a _template-name_ corresponding to the template represented by `r`.
 - `[:r:]::` produces a _nested-name-specifier_ corresponding to the namespace, enumeration type, or class type represented by `r`.


The operand of a splicer is implicitly converted to a `std::meta::info` prvalue (i.e., if the operand expression has a class type that with a conversion function to convert to `std::meta::info`, splicing can still work).

Attempting to splice a reflection value that does not meet the requirement of the splice is ill-formed.
For example:

::: std
```c++
typename[: ^^:: :] x = 0;  // Error.
```
:::

### Addressed Splicing

In the same way that `&C::mem` can produce a pointer, pointer to member data, pointer to function, or pointer to member function depending on what `mem` refers to, `&[: r :]` can likewise produce the same set of pointers if `r` is a reflection of a suitable entity:

*  If `r` is a reflection of a static data member or a variable, `&[:r:]` is a pointer.
*  Otherwise if `r` is a reflection of a non-static data member, `&[:r:]` is a pointer to data member.
*  Otherwise, if `r` is a reflection of a static member function, a function, or a non-static member function with an explicit object parameter, `&[:r:]` is a pointer to function
*  Otherwise, if `r` is a reflection of a non-static member function with an implicit object parameter, `&[:r:]` is a pointer to member function.
*  Otherwise, if `r` is a reflection of a function template or member function template, `&[:r:]` is the address of that overload set - which would then require external context to resolve as usual.

For most members, this doesn't even require any additional wording since that's just what you get when you take the address of the splice based on the current rules we have today.

Now, there are a couple interesting cases to point out when `&[:r:]` isn't just the same as `&X::f`.

When `r` is a reflection of a function or function template that is part of an overload set, overload resolution will not consider the whole overload set, just the specific function or function template that `r` represents:

::: std
```cpp
struct C {
    template <class T> void f(T); // #1
    void f(int); // #2
};

void (C::*p1)(int) = &C::f;  // error: ambiguous

constexpr auto f1 = members_of(^^C, /* function templates named f */)[0];
constexpr auto f2 = members_of(^^C, /* functions named f */)[0];
void (C::*p2)(int) = &[:f1:]; // ok, refers to C::f<int> (#1)
void (C::*p3)(int) = &[:f2:]; // ok, refers to C::f      (#2)
```
:::

Another interesting question is what does this mean when `r` is the reflection of a constructor or destructor? Consider the type:

::: std
```cpp
struct X {
    X(int, int);
};
```
:::

And let `rc` be a reflection of the constructor and `rd` be a reflection of the destructor. The sensible syntax and semantics for how you would use `rc` and `rd` should be as follows:

::: std
```cpp
auto x = [: rc :](1, 2); // gives you an X
x.[: rd :]();            // destroys it
```
:::

Or, with pointers:

::: std
```cpp
auto pc = &[: rc :];
auto pd = &[: rd :];

auto x = (*pc)(1, 2);   // gives you an X
(x.*pd)();              // destroys it
```
:::

That is, splicing a constructor behaves like a free function that produces an object of that type, so `&[: rc :]` has type `X(*)(int, int)`. On the other hand, splicing a destructor behaves like a regular member function, so `&[: rd :]` has type `void (X::*)()`.

However, we are _not_ proposing splicing constructors or destructors at the moment.

### Limitations

Splicers can appear in many contexts, but our implementation experience has uncovered a small set of circumstances in which a splicer must be disallowed. Mostly these are because any entity designated by a splicer can be dependent on a template argument, so any context in which the language already disallows a dependent name must also disallow a dependent splicer. It also becomes possible for the first time to have the "name" of a namespace or concept become dependent on a template argument. Our implementation experience has helped to sort through which uses of these dependent names pose no difficulties, and which must be disallowed.

This proposal places the following limitations on splicers.

#### Splicing reflections of constructors

Iterating over the members of a class (e.g., using `std::meta::members_of`) allows one, for the first time, to obtain "handles" representing constructors. An immediate question arises of whether it's possible to reify these constructors to construct objects, or even to take their address. While we are very interested in exploring these ideas, we defer their discussion to a future paper; this proposal disallows splicing a reflection of a constructor (or constructor template) in any context.

#### Splicing namespaces in namespace definitions

```cpp
namespace A {}
constexpr std::meta::info NS_A = ^^A;

namespace B {
  namespace [:NS_A:] {
    void fn();  // Is this '::A::fn' or '::B::A::fn' ?
  }
}
```

We found no satisfying answer as to how to interpret examples like the one given above. Neither did we find motivating use cases: many of the "interesting" uses for reflections of namespaces are either to introspect their members, or to pass them as template arguments - but the above example does nothing to help with introspection, and neither can namespaces be reopened within any dependent context. Rather than choose between unintuitive options for a syntax without a motivating use case, we are disallowing splicers from appearing in the opening of a namespace.

#### Splicing namespaces in using-directives and using-enum-declarators

```cpp
template <std::meta::info R> void fn1() {
  using enum [:R:]::EnumCls;  // #1
  // ...
}
template <std::meta::info R> void fn2() {
  using namespace [:R:];      // #2
  // ...
}
```

C++20 already disallowed dependent enumeration types from appearing in _using-enum-declarators_ (as in #1), as it would otherwise force the parser to consider every subsequent identifier as possibly a member of the substituted enumeration type. We extend this limitation to splices of dependent reflections of enumeration types, and further disallow the use of dependent reflections of namespaces in _using-directives_ (as in #2) following the same principle.

#### Splicing concepts in declarations of template parameters

```cpp
template <typename T> concept C = requires { requires true; };

template <std::meta::info R> struct Outer {
  template <template [:R:] S> struct Inner { /* ... */ };
};
```

What kind of parameter is `S`? If `R` represents a class template, then it is a non-type template parameter of deduced type, but if `R` represents a concept, it is a type template parameter. There is no other circumstance in the language for which it is not possible to decide at parse time whether a template parameter is a type or a non-type, and we don't wish to introduce one for this use case.

The most obvious solution would be to introduce a `concept [:R:]` syntax that requires that `R` reflect a concept, and while this could be added going forward, we weren't convinced of its value at this time - especially since the above can easily be rewritten:

```cpp
template <std::meta::info R> struct Outer {
  template <typename T> requires template [:R:]<T>
  struct Inner { /* ... */ };
};
```

We are resolving this ambiguity by simply disallowing a reflection of a concept, whether dependent or otherwise, from being spliced in the declaration of a template parameter (thus in the above example, the parser can assume that `S` is a non-type parameter).

#### Splicing class members as designators in designated-initializer-lists

```cpp
struct S { int a; };

constexpr S s = {.[:^^S::a:] = 2};
```

Although we would like for splices of class members to be usable as designators in an initializer-list, we lack implementation experience with the syntax and would first like to verify that there are no issues with dependent reflections. We are very likely to propose this as an extension in a future paper.

### Range Splicers

The splicers described above all take a single object of type `std::meta::info` (described in more detail below).
However, there are many cases where we don't have a single reflection, we have a range of reflections - and we want to splice them all in one go.
For that, the predecessor to this paper, [@P1240R0], proposed an additional form of splicer: a range splicer.

Construct the [struct-to-tuple](#converting-a-struct-to-a-tuple) example from above. It was demonstrated using a single splice, but it would be simpler if we had a range splice:

::: cmptable
### With Single Splice
```c++
template <typename T>
constexpr auto struct_to_tuple(T const& t) {
  constexpr auto members = nonstatic_data_members_of(^^T);

  constexpr auto indices = []{
    std::array<int, members.size()> indices;
    std::ranges::iota(indices, 0);
    return indices;
  }();

  constexpr auto [...Is] = indices;
  return std::make_tuple(t.[: members[Is] :]...);
}
```

### With Range Splice
```c++
template <typename T>
constexpr auto struct_to_tuple(T const& t) {
  constexpr auto members = nonstatic_data_members_of(^^T);
  return std::make_tuple(t.[: ...members :]...);
}
```
:::

A range splice, `[: ... r :]`, would accept as its argument a constant range of `meta::info`, `r`, and  would behave as an unexpanded pack of splices. So the above expression

::: std
```c++
make_tuple(t.[: ... members :]...)
```
:::

would evaluate as

::: std
```c++
make_tuple(t.[:members[0]:], t.[:members[1]:], ..., t.[:members[$N-1$]:])
```
:::

This is a very useful facility indeed!

However, range splicing of dependent arguments is at least an order of magnitude harder to implement than ordinary splicing. We think that not including range splicing gives us a better chance of having reflection in C++26.
Especially since, as this paper's examples demonstrate, a lot can be done without them.

Another way to work around a lack of range splicing would be to implement `with_size<N>(f)`, which would behave like `f(integral_constant<size_t, 0>{}, integral_constant<size_t, 1>{}, ..., integral_constant<size_t, N-1>{})`.
Which is enough for a tolerable implementation:

::: std
```c++
template <typename T>
constexpr auto struct_to_tuple(T const& t) {
  constexpr auto members = nonstatic_data_members_of(^^T);
  return with_size<members.size()>([&](auto... Is){
    return std::make_tuple(t.[: members[Is] :]...);
  });
}
```
:::

### Syntax discussion

Early discussions of splice-like constructs (related to the TS design) considered using `@[unreflexpr]{.cf}@(...)` for that purpose.
[@P1240R0] adopted that option for _expression_ splicing, observing that a single splicing syntax could not viably be parsed (some disambiguation is needed to distinguish types and templates).
SG-7 eventually agreed to adopt the `[: ... :]` syntax --- with disambiguating tokens such as `typename` where needed --- which is a little lighter and more distinctive.

We propose `[:` and `:]` be single tokens rather than combinations of `[`, `]`, and `:`.
Among others, it simplifies the handling of expressions like `arr[[:refl():]]`.
On the flip side, it requires a special rule like the one that was made to handle `<::` to leave the meaning of `arr[::N]` unchanged and another one to avoid breaking a (somewhat useless) attribute specifier of the form `[[using ns:]]`.

A syntax that is delimited on the left and right is useful here because spliced expressions may involve lower-precedence operators. Additionally, it's important that the left- and right-hand delimiters are different so as to allow nested splices when that comes up.

However, there are other possibilities.
For example, now that `$`{.op} or `@`{.op} are available in the basic source character set, we might consider those. One option that was recently brought up was `@ $primary-expression$` which would allow writing `@e` for the simple `$identifier$` splices but for the more complex operations still require parenthesizing for readability. `@[$]{.op}@<$expr$>` is somewhat natural to those of us that have used systems where `$`{.op} is used to expand placeholders in document templates:

|`[::]`|`[: :]` (with space)|`@`|`$`|
|-|-|-|-|
|`[:refl:]`|`[: refl :]`|`@refl`|`$refl`|
|`[:type_of(refl):]`|`[: type_of(refl) :]`|`@(type_of(refl))`|`$(type_of(refl))`|

There are two other pieces of functionality that we will probably need syntax for in the future:

* code injection (of whatever form), and
* annotations (reflectable attributes, as values. [@P1887R1] suggested `+` as an annotation introducer, but `+` can begin an expression so another token is probably better. See also: [this thread](https://lists.isocpp.org/sg7/2023/10/0450.php)).

So any syntax discussion needs to consider the entirety of the feature.


The prefixes `typename` and `template` are only strictly needed in some cases where the operand of the splice is a dependent expression.
In our proposal, however, we only make `typename` optional in the same contexts where it would be optional for qualified names with dependent name qualifiers.
That has the advantage to catch unfortunate errors while keeping a single rule and helping human readers parse the intended meaning of otherwise ambiguous constructs.


## `std::meta::info`

The type `std::meta::info` can be defined as follows:

::: std
```c++
namespace std {
  namespace meta {
    using info = decltype(^^::);
  }
}
```
:::

In our initial proposal a value of type `std::meta::info` can represent:

  - any (C++) type and type alias
  - any function or member function
  - any variable, static data member, or structured binding
  - any non-static data member
  - any enumerator
  - any template
  - any namespace (including the global namespace) or namespace alias
  - any object that is a _permitted result of a constant expression_
  - any value with _structural type_ that is a permitted result of a constant expression
  - the null reflection (when default-constructed)

We for now restrict the space of reflectable values to those of structural type in order to meet two requirements:

1. The compiler must know how to mangle any reflectable value (i.e., when a reflection thereof is used as a template argument).
2. The compiler must know how to compare any two reflectable values, ideally without interpreting user-defined comparison operators (i.e., to implement comparison between reflections).

Values of structural types can already be used as template arguments (so implementations must already know how to mangle them), and the notion of _template-argument-equivalent_ values defined on the class of structural types helps guarantee that `&fn<^^value1> == &fn<^^value2>` if and only if `&fn<value1> == &fn<value2>`.

Notably absent at this time are reflections of expressions. For example, one might wish to walk over the subexpressions of a function call:

::: std
```c++
template <typename T> void fn(T) {}

void g() {
  constexpr auto call = ^^(fn(42));
  static_assert(
      template_arguments_of(function_of(call))[0] ==
      ^^int);
}
```
:::

Previous revisions of this proposal suggested limited support for reflections of constant expressions. The introduction of side effects from constant evaluations (by this very paper), however, renders this roughly as difficult for constant expressions as it is for non-constant expressions. We instead defer all expression reflection to a future paper, and only present value and object reflection in the present proposal.

### Comparing reflections

The type `std::meta::info` is a _scalar_ type for which equality and inequality are meaningful, but for which no ordering relation is defined.

::: std
```c++
static_assert(^^int == ^^int);
static_assert(^^int != ^^const int);
static_assert(^^int != ^^int &);

using Alias = int;
static_assert(^^int != ^^Alias);
static_assert(^^int == dealias(^^Alias));

namespace AliasNS = ::std;
static_assert(^^::std != ^^AliasNS);
static_assert(^^:: == parent_of(^^::std));
```
:::

When the `^^` operator is followed by an _id-expression_, the resulting `std::meta::info` represents the entity named by the expression. Such reflections are equivalent only if they reflect the same entity.

::: std
```c++
int x;
struct S { static int y; };
static_assert(^^x == ^^x);
static_assert(^^x != ^^S::y);
static_assert(^^S::y == static_data_members_of(^^S)[0]);
```
:::

Special rules apply when comparing certain kinds of reflections. A reflection of an alias compares equal to another reflection if and only if they are both aliases, alias the same type, and share the same name and scope. In particular, these rules allow e.g., `fn<^^std::string>` to refer to the same instantiation across translation units.

::: std
```c++
using Alias1 = int;
using Alias2 = int;
consteval std::meta::info fn() {
  using Alias1 = int;
  return ^^Alias;
}
static_assert(^^Alias1 == ^^Alias1);
static_assert(^^Alias1 != ^^int);
static_assert(^^Alias1 != ^^Alias2);
static_assert(^^Alias1 != fn());
}
```
:::

A reflection of an object (including variables) does not compare equally to a reflection of its value. Two values of different types never compare equally.

::: std
```c++
constexpr int i = 42, j = 42;

constexpr std::meta::info r = ^^i, s = ^^i;
static_assert(r == r && r == s);

static_assert(^^i != ^^j);  // 'i' and 'j' are different entities.
static_assert(value_of(^^i) == value_of(^^j));  // Two equivalent values.
static_assert(^^i != std::meta::reflect_object(i))  // A variable is distinct from the
                                                    // object it designates.
static_assert(^^i != std::meta::reflect_value(42));  // A reflection of an object
                                                     // is not the same as its value.
```
:::


### The associated `std::meta` namespace

The namespace `std::meta` is an associated type of `std::meta::info`, which allows standard library meta functions to be invoked without explicit qualification. For example:

::: std
```c++
#include <meta>
struct S {};
std::string name2 = std::meta::identifier_of(^^S);  // Okay.
std::string name1 = identifier_of(^^S);             // Also okay.
```
:::

Default constructing or value-initializing an object of type `std::meta::info` gives it a null reflection value.
A null reflection value is equal to any other null reflection value and is different from any other reflection that refers to one of the mentioned entities.
For example:

::: std
```c++
#include <meta>
struct S {};
static_assert(std::meta::info() == std::meta::info());
static_assert(std::meta::info() != ^^S);
```
:::


## Metafunctions

We propose a number of metafunctions declared in namespace `std::meta` to operator on reflection values.
Adding metafunctions to an implementation is expected to be relatively "easy" compared to implementing the core language features described previously.
However, despite offering a normal consteval C++ function interface, each on of these relies on "compiler magic" to a significant extent.

### Constant evaluation order

In C++23, "constant evaluation" produces pure values without observable side-effects and thus the order in which constant-evaluation occurs is immaterial.
In fact, while the language is designed to permit constant evaluation to happen at compile time, an implementation is not strictly required to take advantage of that possibility.

Some of the proposed metafunctions, however, have side-effects that have an effect on the remainder of the program.
For example, we provide a `define_aggregate` metafunction that provides a definition for a given class.
Clearly, we want the effect of calling that metafunction to be "prompt" in a lexical-order sense.
For example:

::: std
```c++
#include <meta>
struct S;

void g() {
  static_assert(is_type(define_aggregate(^^S, {})));
  S s;  // S should be defined at this point.
}
```
:::


Hence this proposal also introduces constraints on constant evaluation as follows...

First, we identify a subset of manifestly constant-evaluated expressions and conversions characterized by the fact that their evaluation must occur and must succeed in a valid C++ program: We call these _plainly constant-evaluated_.
We require that a programmer can count on those evaluations occurring exactly once and completing at translation time.

Second, we sequence plainly constant-evaluated expressions and conversions within the lexical order.
Specifically, we require that the evaluation of a non-dependent plainly constant-evaluated expression or conversion occurs before the implementation checks the validity of source constructs lexically following that expression or conversion.

Those constraints are mostly intuitive, but they are a significant change to the underlying principles of the current standard in this respect.

[@P2758R1] ("Emitting messages at compile time") also has to deal with side effects during constant evaluation.
However, those effects ("output") are of a slightly different nature in the sense that they can be buffered until a manifestly constant-evaluated expression/conversion has completed.
"Buffering" a class type completion is not practical (e.g., because other metafunctions may well depend on the completed class type).
Still, we are not aware of incompatibilities between our proposal and [@P2758R1].


### Error-Handling in Reflection

Earlier revisions of this proposal suggested several possible approaches to handling errors in reflection metafunctions. This question arises naturally when considering, for instance, examples like `template_of(^^int)`: the argument is a reflection of a type, but that type is not a specialization of a template, so there is no valid template that we can return.

Some of the possibilities that we have considered include:

1. Returning an invalid reflection (similar to `NaN` for floating point) which carries source location info and some useful message (i.e., the approach suggested by P1240)
2. Returning a `std::expected<std::meta::info, E>` for some reflection-specific error type `E`, which carries source location info and some useful message
3. Failing to be a constant expression
4. Throwing an exception of type `E`, which requires a language extension for such exceptions to be catchable during `constexpr` evaluation

We found that we disliked (1) since there is no satisfying value that can be returned for a call like `template_arguments_of(^^int)`: We could return a `std::vector<std::meta::info>` having a single invalid reflection, but this makes for awkward error handling. The experience offered by (3) is at least consistent, but provides no immediate means for a user to "recover" from an error.

Either `std::expected` or constexpr exceptions would allow for a consistent and straightforward interface. Deciding between the two, we noticed that many of usual concerns about exceptions do not apply during translation:

* concerns about runtime performance, object file size, etc. do not exist, and
* concerns about code evolving to add new uncaught exception types do not apply

An interesting example illustrates one reason for our preference for exceptions over `std::expected`:

::: std
```cpp
template <typename T>
  requires (template_of(^^T) == ^^std::optional)
void foo();
```
:::

* If `template_of` returns an `expected<info, E>`, then `foo<int>` is a substitution failure --- `expected<T, E>` is equality-comparable to `T`, that comparison would evaluate to `false` but still be a constant expression.

* If `template_of` returns `info` but throws an exception, then `foo<int>` would cause that exception to be uncaught, which would make the comparison not a constant expression.
This actually makes the constraint ill-formed - not a substitution failure.
In order to have `foo<int>` be a substitution failure, either the constraint would have to first check that `T` is a template or we would have to change the language rule that requires constraints to be constant expressions (we would of course still keep the requirement that the constraint is a `bool`).

Since the R2 revision of this paper, [@P3068R1] has proposed the introduction of constexpr exceptions. The proposal addresses hurdles like compiler modes that disable exception support, and a Clang-based implementation is underway. We believe this to be the most desirable error-handling mechanism for reflection metafunctions.

Because constexpr exceptions have not yet been adopted into the working draft, we do not specify any functions in this paper that throw exceptions. Rather, we propose that they fail to be constant expressions (i.e., case 3 above), and note that this approach will allow us to forward-compatibly add exceptions at a later time. In the interim period, implementations should have all of the information needed to issue helpful diagnostics (e.g., "_note: `R` does not reflect a template specialization_") to improve the experience of writing reflection code.

### Range-Based Metafunctions

There are a number of functions, both in the "core" reflection API that we intend to provide as well as converting some of the standard library type traits that can accept or return a range of `std::meta::info`.

For example:

* `template_arguments_of(^^std::tuple<int>)` is `{^^int}`
* `substitute(^^std::tuple, {^^int})` is `^^std::tuple<int>`

This requires us to answer the question: how do we accept a range parameter and how do we provide a range return.

For return, we intend on returning `std::vector<std::meta::info>` from all such APIs. This is by far the easiest for users to deal with. We definitely don't want to return a `std::span<std::meta::info const>`, since this requires keeping all the information in the compiler memory forever (unlike `std::vector` which could free its allocation). The only other option would be a custom container type which is optimized for compile-time by being able to produce elements lazily on demand - i.e. so that `nonstatic_data_members_of(^^T)[3]` wouldn't have to populate _all_ the data members, just do enough work to be able to return the 4th one. But that adds a lot of complexity that's probably not worth the effort.

For parameters, there are basically three options:

1. Accept `std::span<std::meta::info const>`, which now accepts braced-init-list arguments so it's pretty convenient in this regard.
2. Accept `std::vector<std::meta::info>`
3. Accept _any_ range whose `type_value` is `std::meta::info`.

Now, for compiler efficiency reasons, it's definitely better to have all the arguments contiguously. So the compiler wants `span` (or something like it). There's really no reason to prefer `vector` over `span`. Accepting any range would look something like this:

::: std
```cpp
namespace std::meta {
    template <typename R>
    concept reflection_range = ranges::input_range<R>
                            && same_as<ranges::range_value_t<R>, info>;

    template <reflection_range R = initializer_list<info>>
    consteval auto substitute(info tmpl, R&& args) -> info;
}
```
:::

This API is more user friendly than accepting `span<info const>` by virtue of simply accepting more kinds of ranges. The default template argument allows for braced-init-lists to still work. [Example](https://godbolt.org/z/P49MPhn4T).

Specifically, if the user is doing anything with range adaptors, they will either end up with a non-contiguous or non-sized range, which will no longer be convertible to `span` - so they will have to manually convert their range to a `vector<info>` in order to pass it to the algorithm. Because the implementation wants contiguity anyway, that conversion to `vector` will happen either way - so it's just a matter of whether every call needs to do it manually or the implementation can just do it once.

For example, converting a struct to a tuple type:

::: cmptable
### `span` only
```cpp
consteval auto type_struct_to_tuple(info type) -> meta::info {
    return substitute(
        ^^tuple,
        nonstatic_data_members_of(type)
        | views::transform(meta::type_of)
        | views::transform(meta::remove_cvref)
        | ranges::to<vector>());
}
```

### any range
```cpp
consteval auto type_struct_to_tuple(info type) -> meta::info {
    return substitute(
        ^^tuple,
        nonstatic_data_members_of(type)
        | views::transform(meta::type_of)
        | views::transform(meta::remove_cvref)
        );
}
```
:::

This shouldn't cause much compilation overhead. Checking convertibility to `span` _already_ uses Ranges machinery. And implementations can just do the right thing interally:

::: std
```cpp
consteval auto __builtin_substitute(info tmpl, info const* arg, size_t num_args) -> info;

template <reflection_range R = initializer_list<info>>
consteval auto substitute(info tmpl, R&& args) -> info {
    if constexpr (ranges::sized_range<R> && ranges::contiguous_range<R>) {
        return __builtin_substitute(tmpl, ranges::data(args), ranges::size(args));
    } else {
        auto as_vector = ranges::to<vector<info>>((R&&)args);
        return __builtin_substitute(tmpl, as_vector.data(), as_vector.size());
    }
}
```
:::

As such, we propose that all the range-accepting algorithms accept any range.

### Handling Aliases

Consider

::: std
```cpp
using A = int;
```
:::

In C++ today, `A` and `int` can be used interchangeably and there is no distinction between the two types.
With reflection as proposed in this paper, that will no longer be the case.
`^^A` yields a reflection of an alias to `int`, while `^^int` yields a reflection of `int`.
`^^A == ^^int` evaluates to `false`, but there will be a way to strip aliases - so `dealias(^^A) == ^^int` evaluates to `true`.

This opens up the question of how various other metafunctions handle aliases and it is worth going over a few examples:

::: std
```cpp
using A = int;
using B = std::unique_ptr<int>;
template <class T> using C = std::unique_ptr<T>;
```
:::

This paper is proposing that:

* `is_type(^^A)` is `true`.
   `^^A` is an alias, but it's an alias to a type, and if this evaluated as `false` then everyone would have to `dealias` everything all the time.
* `has_template_arguments(^^B)` is `false` while `has_template_arguments(^^C<int>)` is `true`.
  Even though `B` is an alias to a type that itself has template arguments (`unique_ptr<int>`), `B` itself is simply a type alias and does not.
  This reflects the actual usage.
* Meanwhile, `template_arguments_of(^^C<int>)` yields `{^^int}` while `template_arguments_of(^^std::unique_ptr<int>)` yields `{^^int, ^^std::default_deleter<int>}`.
  This is because `C` has its own template arguments that can be reflected on.

What about when querying the type of an entity?

::: std
```cpp
std::string Str;
const std::string &Ref = Str;

constexpr std::meta::info StrTy = type_of(^^Str);
constexpr std::meta::info RefTy = type_of(^^Ref);
```
:::

What are `StrTy` and `RefTy`? This question is more difficult. Two distinct issues complicate the answer:

1. Our experience using these facilities has consistently shown that if `StrTy` represents `std::string`, many uses of `StrTy` require writing `dealias(StrTy)` rather than using `StrTy` directly (because a reflection of a type aliases compares unequal with a reflection of the aliased type). Failure to do so often yields subtle bugs.

2. While we would like for `RefTy` to represent `const std::string &`, it can only represent `const std::basic_string<char, std::allocator<char>> &`. Why? Because since `std::string` is only a "name" for `std::basic_string<char, std::allocator<char>>`, the language provides no semantic answer to what "`const std::string &`" _is_. It is only a source-level "grammatical" construct: A _type-id_. Reflecting type-ids is a brittle path, since it opens questions like whether a reflection of `const int` is the same as a reflection of `int const`. Furthermore, nothing currently requires an implementation to "remember" that the type of `Ref` was "spelled" with the alias `std::string` after parsing it, and we aren't confident that all major implementations do so today. Lastly, even if we _could_ form a reflection of `const std::string &`, our existing metafunction and type-trait "machinery" gives no means of unwrapping the cv-ref qualification to get `^^std::string` without decaying all the way to `^^std::basic_string<char, std::allocator<char>>`.

In light of the above, our position is that `type_of` should never return aliases: That is, `StrTy` represents `std::basic_string<char, std::allocator<char>>`. We believe that it would be desirable to in the future introduce an `aliased_type_of` function capable of returning representations of both `std::string` and `const std::string &` for `Str` and `Ref` respectively - but this requires both discussions with implementers, and likely new wording technology for the Standard. To avoid jeopardizing the goal declared by the title of this paper, we are not proposing such a function at this time.

### Reflecting source text

One of the most "obvious" abilities of reflection --- retrieving the name of an entity --- turns out to raise
issues that aren't obvious at all: How do we represent source text in a C++ program?

Thanks to recent work originating in SG16 (the "Unicode" study group) we can assume that all source code is
ultimately representable as Unicode code points.  C++ now also has types to represent UTF-8-encoded text
(incl. `char8_t`, `u8string`, and `u8string_view`) and corresponding literals like `u8"Hi"`.  Unfortunately,
what can be done with those types is still limited at the time of this writing.  For example,

::: std
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  std::cout << u8"こんにちは世界\n";
}
```
:::

is not standard C++ because the standard output stream does not have support for UTF-8 literals.

In practice ordinary strings encoded in the "ordinary literal encoding" (which may or may not be UTF-8)
are often used.  We therefore need mechanisms to produce the corresponding ordinary string types as well.

Orthogonal to the character representation is the data structure used to traffic in source text.  An
implementation can easily have at least three potential representations of reflected source text:

  a) the internal representation used, e.g., in the compiler front end's AST-like structures (persistent)

  b) the representation of string literals in the AST (persistent)

  c) the representation of array of character values during constant-evaluation (transient)

(some compilers might share some of those representations).  For transient text during constant evaluation we'd
like to use `string`/`u8string` values, but because of the limitations on non-transient allocation during
constant evaluation we cannot easily transfer such types to the non-constant (i.e., run-time) environment.
E.g., if `identifier_of` were a (consteval) metafunction returning a `std::string` value, the following simple
example would not work:

::: std
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <meta>
int main() {
  int hello_world = 42;
  std::cout << identifier_of(^^hello_world) << "\n";  // Doesn't work if identifier_of produces a std::string.
}
```
:::

We can instead return a `std::string_view` or `std::u8string_view`, but that has the downside
that it effectively makes all results of querying source text persistent for the compilation.

For now, however, we propose that queries like `identifier_of` do produce "string view" results.
For example:

::: std
```cpp
consteval std::string_view identifier_of(info);
consteval std::u8string_view identifier_of(info);
```
:::


An alternative strategy that we considered is the introduction of a "proxy type" for source text:

::: std
```cpp
namespace std::meta {
  struct source_text_info {
    ...
    template<typename T>
      requires (^^T == dealias(^^std::string_view) || ^^T == dealias(^^std::u8string_view) ||
                ^^T == dealias(^^std::string) || ^^T == dealias(^^std::u8string))
      consteval T as();
    ...
  };
}
```
:::

where the `as<...>()` member function produces a string-like type as desired.  That idea was dropped,
however, because it became unwieldy in actual use cases.

With a source text query like `identifier_of(refl)` it is possible that the some source
characters of the result are not representable.  We can then consider multiple options, including:

  1) the query fails to evaluate,

  2) any unrepresentable source characters are translated to a different presentation,
     such as universal-character-names of the form `\u{ $hex-number$ }`,

  3) any source characters not in the basic source character set are translated to a different
     presentation (as in (2)).

Following much discussion with SG16, we propose #1: The query fails to evaluate if the identifier cannot be represented in the ordinary literal encoding.

### Reflecting names

Earlier revisions of this proposal (and its predecessor, [@P1240R2]) included a metafunction called `name_of`, which we defined to return a `string_view` containing the "name" of the reflected entity. As the paper evolved, it became necessary to sharpen the specification of what this "name" contains. Subsequent revisions (beginning with P2996R2, presented in Tokyo) specified that `name_of` returns the unqualified name, whereas a new `qualified_name_of` would give the fully qualified name.

Most would agree that `qualified_name_of(^^size_t)` might reasonably return `"std::size_t"`, or that `qualified_name_of(^^std::any::reset)` could return `"std::any::reset"`. But what about for local variables, or members of local classes? Should inline and anonymous namespaces be rendered as a part of the qualified name? Should we standardize the spelling of such scopes, or leave it implementation defined?

The situation is possibly even less clear for unqualified names. Should cv-qualified types be rendered as `const int` or `int const`? Should the type for a function returning a pointer be rendered as `T *(*)()`, `T* (*)()`, or `T * (*)()`? Should such decisions be standardized, or left to implementations? But the real kicker is when one considers non-type template arguments, which can (and do) contain arbitrarily complex values of arbitrary structural types (along with any complete object, or subobject thereof, which has static storage duration).

The more that we tried to specify formatting behavior for just the unqualified names of arbitrary types, the more convinced we became that this did not feel like an algorithm that should be frozen in the standard library - at least, not at this time. There are just too many toggles that a programmer might reasonably want to flip (one need only look at [Clang's `PrettyPrinter` class](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/248c53429427034f45705af60d47f3b1090c4799/clang/include/clang/AST/PrettyPrinter.h#L59-L80) for inspiration). On the other hand, it is perfectly reasonable to ask that implementations give _some_ means of describing what it is that a reflection contains - that is exactly the purpose of the `display_string_of` function.

Our stance is therefore that reflection pretty printers, for now, should be left to organically develop within the ecosystem of open-source C++ libraries. To ensure that this is possible, the Clang/P2996 fork has implemented its `display_string_of` metafunction entirely within the library. It is capable of printing type names, value representations, template arguments, and much more. Best of all, it can be extended without modifying the compiler.

What of `name_of` and `qualified_name_of`? As of the R5 revision of this paper, we have removed them. In their stead is `identifier_of`, which is only a constant expression if the name of the represented construct is an identifier, and `has_identifier` for checking this condition. A few other metafunctions fill in some gaps: `operator_of` determines the identity of an overloaded operator, and predicates like `is_operator_function` and `is_conversion_function_template` let printing libraries handle those unqualified names that are not identifiers. `parent_of` supports walking up the chain of functions, namespaces, and classes enclosing the declaration of an entity, thus enabling homegrown implementations of `qualified_name_of`. Meanwhile, the prime real estate of `name_of` remains available for future library extensions.

As a nice side-effect, the `identifier_of` model altogether dodges some contentious questions that arose during LEWG discussions in St Louis: Should asking the "name" of an anonymous entity (e.g., anonymous unions) return the empty string, or fail to be a constant expression? Since the C++ grammar requires that an `$identifier$` contain at least one character, the `identifier_of` function never returns an empty string: it is seen that the only possibility is to fail to be a constant expression.

### Reachability and injected declarations

Certain metafunctions (e.g., `members_of`) return reflections that represent entities without ever naming those entities in source code (i.e., eliding lookup). Although it is often clear which entities should be returned from the perspective of a reader, or even the perspective of an implementation, core wording has no notion that directly corresponds to "compilation state".

Lookup is rather defined in terms of "reachability", which is roughly a mapping from a "program point" to the set of declarations _reachable_ from that point. Lookup frequently occurs from a single point, but template instantiation (and a few other niche circumstances) can lead to lookup taking place from multiple points (i.e., the point in a template from which a name is specified, and the point from which the template was instantiated). The set of points from which lookup takes place is the _instantiation context_ ([module.context]).

::: std
```c++
template <typename T> int fn() {
  return /*P1*/ T::value;
}

struct S { static const int value = 42; }

int main() {
  return /*P2*/ fn<S>();
}

// The instantiation context when looking up 'S::value' in 'fn<T>' is {P1, P2}.
// Even though 'S' is not found from P1, it is found from P2; lookup succeeds.
```
:::

This works because the notion of template instantiation is baked into the definition of "instantiation context", which is thereafter used to define lookup. But we have no such benefit in the case of metafunctions like `members_of`, which do not utilize template instantiation.

::: std
```c++
consteval size_t count_fields(std::meta::info Ty) {
  return /*P1*/ nonstatic_data_members_of(Ty).size();
}

struct S { int i, j, k; }
static_assert(/*P2*/ count_fields(^^S) == 3);
```
:::

If we naively define `nonstatic_data_members_of` to return members reachable from the "point of call", then the above code would fail: after all, `S` is not reachable from `$P1$`. We instead must define the declarations to be those reachable from where constant evaluation begins (i.e., `$P2$`). We encode this idea in our definition of the _evaluation context_:

::: std
::: addu
[22]{.pnum} During the evaluation of a manifestly constant-evaluated expression `$M$`, the evaluation context of an expression `$E$` comprises [...] the instantiation context of `$M$` ([module.context]), [...] .
:::
:::

This gives the tool needed to define the declarations returned by `members_of` to be (roughly) those reachable from the _evaluation context_. However, a second problem related to reachability is posed by `define_aggregate`.

::: std
```c++
consteval std::meta::info make_defn(std::meta::info Cls, std::meta::info Mem) {
  // Synthesizes:
  //   struct Mem {};
  //   struct Cls { Mem m; };
  return /*P1*/ define_aggregate(Cls, {
    data_member_spec(/*P2*/ define_aggregate(Mem, {}), {.name="m"})
  });
}

/* P3*/ struct C;
/* P4*/ struct M;
static_assert(/*P5*/ is_type(make_defn(^^C, ^^M)) /*P6*/);

/*P7*/ C obj;
```
:::

Although we want this code to be valid, we have several obstacles to navigate.

1. How can definitions for `C` and `M` be defined from `$P1$` and `$P2$` when no declarations of those classes are reachable from those program points?
2. Where are the points of declaration for the generated definitions of `C` and `M` (i.e., from what program points will the generated definitions be reachable)?
3. How can we ensure that the definition of `M` is reachable during the evaluation of `define_aggregate` on `C`?

The prior discourse regarding `members_of` gives a straightforward answer to (1); the `define_aggregate` function is defined in terms of the _evaluation context_, which makes available all declarations reachable from `$P5$`.

An answer to (2) can be seen by considering the declarations at `$P3$`, `$P4$`, and `$P7$`: Since we want the declaration of `obj` to be well-formed, the generated definition of `C` must precede `$P7$`. On the other hand, placing the definition of `$C$` prior to `$P4$` would weirdly place the definition of the class `C`, which contains a data memer of type `M`, prior to the declaration of `M` itself. We propose that the point of declaration for all definitions generated by `define_aggregate` immediately follows the end of the manifestly constant-evaluated expression that produces the definition: In this case, just prior to `$P6$`.

This leaves one gap, and it is the question posed by (3): If the definition of `M`, generated by evaluation of `define_aggregate(Mem, {})`, is located just prior to `$P6$`, then the definition is still not reachable from the evaluation context (such as we have defined it) during evaluation of `define_aggregate(Cls, ...)`.

Circling back to "reachability" as a mapping from program points to declarations, there are two clear paths forward: Either modify which declarations are reachable from a program point, or modify the set of program points in the evaluation context. We choose the later approach, and attempt to provide some machinery that can be reused for future "generative reflection" proposals.

We begin by specially indicating that the generated definitions of `C` and `M` are not just declarations, but _injected declarations_, and that such injected declarations are _produced_ by an evaluation of an expression. The reachability of these declarations is evidently different from other declarations: It depends not only on a program point, but also on which compile-time evaluations of expressions (which have no relation to lexical ordering) are _sequenced after_ the production of the injected declarations.

To bridge the world of program points to the world of sequenced evaluations, we introduce a notion dual to "injected declarations": For every injected declaration, there is a corresponding _synthesized point_. Injected points have a special property: the _only_ declaration reachable from a synthesized point is its corresponding injected declaration. Jumping back to our above example, joining the synthesized point of the injected declaration of `M` to our evaluation context gives exactly what is needed for `M` to be usable during the definition of `C`. More precisely: `M` is reachable during the definition of `C` because the evaluation of the expression that produces the definition of `M` is _sequenced before_ the evalauation of the expression that produces `C`. This is captured by our full and final definition of the evaluation context:

::: std
::: addu
[22]{.pnum} The _evaluation context_ is a set of points within the program that determines which declarations are found by certain expressions used for reflection. During the evaluation of a manifestly constant-evaluated expression `$M$`, the evaluation context of an expression `$E$` comprises the union of

* [#.#]{.pnum} the instantiation context of `$M$` ([module.context]), and
* [#.#]{.pnum} the synthesized points corresponding to any injected declarations ([expr.const]) produced by evaluations sequenced before the next evaluation of `$E$`.
:::
:::

Lastly, we clarify that during the definition of an _injected declaration_, the instantiation context consists of the _evaluation context_ of the expression that is producing the declaration. In our example above, this ensures that the definition of `$M$` is reachable not just from the invocation of `define_aggregate` for `C`, but from within the actual generated definition of `$C$`.

This machinery is "off in the weeds" of technicalities related to modules, lookup, etc., but we believe (hope?) that it provides a sound basis upon which to build generative reflection within the framework provided by core language wording: not only for P2996, but for future papers as well.


### Freestanding implementations

Several important metafunctions, such as `std::meta::nonstatic_data_members_of`, return a `std::vector` value.
Unfortunately, that means that they are currently not usable in a freestanding environment, but [@P3295R0] currently proposes freestanding `std::vector`, `std::string`, and `std::allocator` in constant evaluated contexts, explicitly to make the facilities proposed by this paper work in freestanding.

### `identifier_of`, `display_string_of`, `source_location_of` {#name-loc}

::: std
```c++
namespace std::meta {
  consteval auto identifier_of(info) -> string_view;
  consteval auto u8identifier_of(info) -> u8string_view;

  consteval auto display_string_of(info) -> string_view;
  consteval auto u8display_string_of(info) -> u8string_view;

  consteval auto has_identifier(info) -> bool;

  consteval auto source_location_of(info r) -> source_location;
}
```
:::

Given a reflection `r` representing a language construct `X` whose declaration introduces an identifier, and if that identifier is representable using the ordinary literal encoding, then `identifier_of(r)` returns a non-empty `string_view` containing that identifier. Otherwise, it is not a constant expression. Whether a reflected construct has an identifier can be checked with the `has_identifier` metafunction.

The function `u8identifier_of` returns the same identifier but as a `u8string_view`. Note that since all identifiers can be represented as UTF-8 string literals, `u8identifier_of` never fails to be a constant expression because of representability concerns.

Given any reflection `r`, `display_string_of(r)` and `u8display_string_of(r)` return an unspecified non-empty `string_view` and `u8string_view`, respectively.
Implementations are encouraged to produce text that is helpful in identifying the reflected construct (note: as an exercise, the Clang implementation of this proposal implements a pretty-printing `display_string_of` [as a non-intrinsic library function](https://github.com/bloomberg/clang-p2996/blob/8ce6449538510a2330f7227f53b40be7671b0b91/libcxx/include/experimental/meta#L2088-L2731)).

Given a reflection `r`, `source_location_of(r)` returns an unspecified `source_location`.
Implementations are encouraged to produce the correct source location of the item designated by the reflection.

### `type_of`, `parent_of`, `dealias`

::: std
```c++
namespace std::meta {
  consteval auto type_of(info r) -> info;
  consteval auto parent_of(info r) -> info;
  consteval auto dealias(info r) -> info;
}
```
:::

If `r` is a reflection designating a typed entity, `type_of(r)` is a reflection designating its type.
If `r` is already a type, `type_of(r)` is not a constant expression.
This can be used to implement the C `typeof` feature (which works on both types and expressions and strips qualifiers):

::: std
```cpp
consteval auto type_doof(std::meta::info r) -> std::meta::info {
  return remove_cvref(is_type(r) ? r : type_of(r));
}

#define typeof(e) [: type_doof(^^e) :]
```
:::

`parent_of(r)` is a reflection designating its immediately enclosing class, function, or (possibly inline or anonymous) namespace.

If `r` represents an alias, `dealias(r)` represents the underlying entity.
Otherwise, `dealias(r)` produces `r`.
`dealias` is recursive - it strips all aliases:

::: std
```cpp
using X = int;
using Y = X;
static_assert(dealias(^^int) == ^^int);
static_assert(dealias(^^X) == ^^int);
static_assert(dealias(^^Y) == ^^int);
```
:::

### `object_of`, `value_of`

::: std
```c++
namespace std::meta {
  consteval auto object_of(info r) -> info;
  consteval auto value_of(info r) -> info;
}
```
:::

If `r` is a reflection of a variable denoting an object with static storage duration, then `object_of(r)` is a reflection of the object designated by the variable. If `r` is already a reflection of an object, `object_of(r)` is `r`. For all other inputs, `object_of(r)` is not a constant expression.

::: std
```c++
int x;
int &y = x;

static_assert(^^x != ^^y);
static_assert(object_of(^^x) == object_of(^^y));
```
:::

If `r` is a reflection of an enumerator, then `value_of(r)` is a reflection of the value of the enumerator. Otherwise, if `r` is a reflection of an object _usable in constant expressions_, then `value_of(r)` is a reflection of the value of the object. For all other inputs, `value_of(r)` is not a constant expression.

### `template_of`, `template_arguments_of`

::: std
```c++
namespace std::meta {
  consteval auto template_of(info r) -> info;
  consteval auto template_arguments_of(info r) -> vector<info>;
}
```
:::

If `r` is a reflection designating a specialization of some template, then `template_of(r)` is a reflection of that template and `template_arguments_of(r)` is a vector of the reflections of the template arguments. In other words, the preconditions on both is that `has_template_arguments(r)` is `true`.

For example:

::: std
```c++
std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
static_assert(template_of(type_of(^^v)) == ^^std::vector);
static_assert(template_arguments_of(type_of(^^v))[0] == ^^int);
```
:::



### `members_of`, `static_data_members_of`, `nonstatic_data_members_of`, `bases_of`, `enumerators_of` {#member-queries}

::: std
```c++
namespace std::meta {
  consteval auto members_of(info r) -> vector<info>;
  consteval auto bases_of(info type_class) -> vector<info>;

  consteval auto static_data_members_of(info type_class) -> vector<info>;
  consteval auto nonstatic_data_members_of(info type_class) -> vector<info>;

  consteval auto enumerators_of(info type_enum) -> vector<info>;

  consteval auto get_public_members(info type_class) -> vector<info>;
  consteval auto get_public_static_data_members(info type_class) -> vector<info>;
  consteval auto get_public_nonstatic_data_members(info type_class) -> vector<info>;
  consteval auto get_public_bases(info type_class) -> vector<info>;
}
```
:::

The template `members_of` returns a vector of reflections representing the direct members of the class type or namespace represented by its first argument.
Any non-static data members appear in declaration order within that vector.
Anonymous unions appear as a non-static data member of corresponding union type.
Reflections of structured bindings shall not appear in the returned vector.

The template `bases_of` returns the direct base classes of the class type represented by its first argument, in declaration order.

`static_data_members_of` and `nonstatic_data_members_of` return reflections of the static and non-static data members, in order, respectively.

`enumerators_of` returns the enumerator constants of the indicated enumeration type in declaration order.

The `get_public_meow` functions are equivalent to `meow_of` functions except that they additionally filter the results on those members for which `is_public(member)` is `true`.
The only other distinction is that `members_of` can be invoked on a namespace, while `get_public_members` can only be invoked on a class type (because it does not make sense to ask for the public members of a namespace).
This set of functions has a distinct API by demand for ease of grepping.

### `substitute`

::: std
```c++
namespace std::meta {
  template <reflection_range R = initializer_list<info>>
  consteval auto can_substitute(info templ, R&& args) -> bool;
  template <reflection_range R = initializer_list<info>>
  consteval auto substitute(info templ, R&& args) -> info;
}
```
:::

Given a reflection for a template and reflections for template arguments that match that template, `substitute` returns a reflection for the entity obtained by substituting the given arguments in the template.
If the template is a concept template, the result is a reflection of a constant of type `bool`.

For example:

::: std
```c++
constexpr auto r = substitute(^^std::vector, std::vector{^^int});
using T = [:r:]; // Ok, T is std::vector<int>
```
:::

This process might kick off instantiations outside the immediate context, which can lead to the program being ill-formed.

Note that the template is only substituted, not instantiated.  For example:

::: std
```c++
template<typename T> struct S { typename T::X x; };

constexpr auto r = substitute(^^S, std::vector{^^int});  // Okay.
typename[:r:] si;  // Error: T::X is invalid for T = int.
```
:::

`can_substitute(templ, args)` simply checks if the substitution can succeed (with the same caveat about instantiations outside of the immediate context).
If `can_substitute(templ, args)` is `false`, then `substitute(templ, args)` will be ill-formed.

### `reflect_value`, `reflect_object`, `reflect_function` {#reflect-expression-results}

::: std
```c++
namespace std::meta {
  template<typename T> consteval auto reflect_value(const T& expr) -> info;
  template<typename T> consteval auto reflect_object(T& expr) -> info;
  template<typename T> consteval auto reflect_function(T& expr) -> info;
}
```
:::

These metafunctions produce a reflection of the _result_ from evaluating the provided expression. One of the most common use-cases for such reflections is to specify the template arguments with which to build a specialization using `std::meta::substitute`.

`reflect_value(expr)` produces a reflection of the value computed by an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion on `expr`. The type of the reflected value is the cv-unqualified (de-aliased) type of `expr`. The result needs to be a permitted result of a constant expression, and `T` cannot be of reference type.

```cpp
static_assert(substitute(^^std::array, {^^int, std::meta::reflect_value(5)}) ==
              ^^std::array<int, 5>);
```

`reflect_object(expr)` produces a reflection of the object designated by `expr`. This is frequently used to obtain a reflection of a subobject, which might then be used as a template argument for a non-type template parameter of reference type.

```cpp
template <int &> void fn();

int p[2];
constexpr auto r = substitute(^^fn, {std::meta::reflect_object(p[1])});
```

`reflect_function(expr)` produces a reflection of the function designated by `expr`. It can be useful for reflecting on the properties of a function for which only a reference is available.

```cpp
consteval bool is_global_with_external_linkage(void(*fn)()) {
  std::meta::info rfn = std::meta::reflect_function(*fn);

  return (has_external_linkage(rfn) && parent_of(rfn) == ^^::);
}
```

### `extract<T>`

::: std
```c++
namespace std::meta {
  template<typename T> consteval auto extract(info) -> T;
}
```
:::

If `r` is a reflection for a value of type `T`, `extract<T>(r)` is a prvalue whose evaluation computes the reflected value.

If `r` is a reflection for an object of non-reference type `T`, `extract<T&>(r)` and `extract<T const&>(r)` are lvalues referring to that object.
If the object is usable in constant expressions [expr.const], `extract<T>(r)` evaluates to its value.

If `r` is a reflection for an object of reference type `T` usable in constant-expressions, `extract<T>(r)` evaluates to that reference.

If `r` is a reflection for a function of type `F`, `extract<F*>(r)` evaluates to a pointer to that function.

If `r` is a reflection for a non-static member function and `T` is the type for a pointer to the reflected member function, `extract<T>(r)` evaluates to a pointer to the member function.

If `r` is a reflection for an enumerator constant of type `E`, `extract<E>(r)` evaluates to the value of that enumerator.

If `r` is a reflection for a non-bit-field non-reference non-static member of type `M` in a class `C`, `extract<M C::*>(r)` is the pointer-to-member value for that non-static member.

For other reflection values `r`, `extrace<T>(r)` is ill-formed.

The function template `extract` may feel similar to splicers, but unlike splicers it does not require its operand to be a constant-expression itself.
Also unlike splicers, it requires knowledge of the type associated with the entity represented by its operand.

### `data_member_spec`, `define_aggregate`

::: std
```c++
namespace std::meta {
  struct data_member_options {
    struct name_type {
      template <typename T> requires constructible_from<u8string, T>
        consteval name_type(T &&);

      template <typename T> requires constructible_from<string, T>
        consteval name_type(T &&);
    };

    optional<name_type> name;
    optional<int> alignment;
    optional<int> bit_width;
    bool no_unique_address = false;
  };
  consteval auto data_member_spec(info type,
                                  data_member_options options) -> info;
  template <reflection_range R = initializer_list<info>>
  consteval auto define_aggregate(info type_class, R&&) -> info;
}
```
:::

`data_member_spec` returns a reflection of a data member description for a data member of given type. Optional alignment, bit-field-width, and name can be provided as well. An inner class `name_type`, which may be implicitly constructed from any of several "string-like" types (e.g., `string_view`, `u8string_view`, `char8_t[]`, `char_t[]`), is used to represent the name. If a `name` is provided, it must be a valid identifier when interpreted as a sequence of code-units. Otherwise, the name of the data member is unspecified.

`define_aggregate` takes the reflection of an incomplete class/struct/union type and a range of reflections of data member descriptions and completes the given class type with data members as described (in the given order).
The given reflection is returned. For now, only data member reflections are supported (via `data_member_spec`) but the API takes in a range of `info` anticipating expanding this in the near future.

For example:

::: std
```c++
union U;
static_assert(is_type(define_aggregate(^^U, {
  data_member_spec(^^int),
  data_member_spec(^^char),
  data_member_spec(^^double),
})));

// U is now defined to the equivalent of
// union U {
//   int $_0$;
//   char $_1$;
//   double $_2$;
// };

template<typename T> struct S;
constexpr auto s_int_refl = define_aggregate(^^S<int>, {
  data_member_spec(^^int, {.name="i", .alignment=64}),
  data_member_spec(^^int, {.name=u8"こんにち"}),
});

// S<int> is now defined to the equivalent of
// template<> struct S<int> {
//   alignas(64) int i;
//               int こんにち;
// };
```
:::

When defining a `union`, if one of the alternatives has a non-trivial destructor, the defined union will _still_ have a destructor provided - that simply does nothing.
This allows implementing [variant](#a-simple-variant-type) without having to further extend support in `define_aggregate` for member functions.

If `define_aggregate` is called multiple times with the same arguments, all calls after the first will have no effect. Calling `define_aggregate` for a type that was defined using other arguments, defined through other means, or is in the process of being defined, is not a constant expression.

Revisions of this paper prior to P2996R8 named this function `define_class`. We find `define_aggregate` to be a better name for a few reasons:

1. The capabilities of the function are quite limited, and are mostly good for constructing aggregate types.
2. The new name provides good cause for forcing all data members to be public. Private data members created through such an interface are of very limited utility.
3. The name `define_class` is left available for a future, more fully-featured API.

### Data Layout Reflection
::: std
```c++
namespace std::meta {
  struct member_offset {
    ptrdiff_t bytes;
    ptrdiff_t bits;

    constexpr auto total_bits() const -> ptrdiff_t {
      return CHAR_BIT * bytes + bits;
    }

    auto operator<=>(member_offset const&) const = default;
  };

  consteval auto offset_of(info r) -> member_offset;
  consteval auto size_of(info r) -> size_t;
  consteval auto alignment_of(info r) -> size_t;
  consteval auto bit_size_of(info r) -> size_t;

}
```
:::

These are generalized versions of some facilities we already have in the language.

* `offset_of` takes a reflection of a non-static data member or a base class subobject and returns the offset of it - in bytes and then leftover bits (always between `0` and `7` inclusive).
* `size_of` takes the reflection of a type, object, variable, non-static data member, or base class subobject and returns its size.
* `alignment_of` takes the reflection of a type, non-static data member, or base class subobject and returns its alignment.
* `bit_size_of` gives the size of a base class subobject or non-static data member, except in bits.

::: std
```cpp
struct Msg {
    uint64_t a : 10;
    uint64_t b :  8;
    uint64_t c : 25;

};

static_assert(offset_of(^^Msg::a) == member_offset{0, 0});
static_assert(offset_of(^^Msg::b) == member_offset{1, 2});
static_assert(offset_of(^^Msg::c) == member_offset{2, 2});

static_assert(offset_of(^^Msg::c).total_bits() == 18);
static_assert(offset_of(^^Msg::d).total_bits() == 43);

### Other Type Traits

There is a question of whether all the type traits should be provided in `std::meta`.
For instance, a few examples in this paper use `std::meta::remove_cvref(t)` as if that exists.
Technically, the functionality isn't strictly necessary - since it can be provided indirectly:

::: cmptable
### Direct
```cpp
remove_cvref(type)
```

### Indirect
```cpp
dealias(substitute(^^std::remove_cvref_t, {type}))
```

---

```cpp
is_const_type(type)
```

```cpp
extract<bool>(substitute(^^std::is_const_v, {type}))
```
:::

The indirect approach is a lot more typing, and you have to remember to `dealias` the result of the type traits as well (because `substitute(^^std::remove_cvref_t, {^^int const})` gives you a reflection of an alias to `int`, not a reflection of `int`), so it's both more tedious and more error prone.

Having `std::meta::meow` for every trait `std::meow` is more straightforward and will likely be faster to compile, though means we will have a much larger library API. There are quite a few traits in [meta]{.sref} - but it should be easy enough to specify all of them.
So we're doing it.

Now, one thing that came up is that the straightforward thing we want to do is to simply add a `std::meta::meow` for every trait `std::meow` and word it appropriately. That's what we initially tried to do. However, we've run into some conflicts.

The standard library type traits are all *type* traits - they only accept types.
As such, their names are simply things like `std::is_pointer`, `std::is_const`, `std::is_lvalue_reference`, and so forth.
Renaming it to `std::type_is_pointer`, for instance, would be a waste of characters since there's nothing else the argument could be save for a type.

But this is no longer the case. Consider the name `is_function`. It could be:

1. A consteval function equivalent of the type trait `std::is_function<T>`, such that `std::meta::is_function(e)` mandates that `e` represents a type and checks if that type is a function type.

2. A new kind of reflection query `std::meta::is_function(e)` which asks if `e` is the reflection of a function (as opposed to a type or a namespace or a template, etc.).
  This is the same category of query as `std::meta::is_template` or `std::meta::is_concept` or `std::meta::is_namespace`.

Both of these are useful, yet they mean different things entirely - the first is ill-formed when passed a reflection of a function (as opposed to a function type), and the second would simply answer `false` for the reflection of _any_ type (function type or otherwise).

Moreover, in this case it's actually important that the reflection query `std::meta::is_function` does _not_ return `true` for a function type so that using `is_function` as a filter for `members_of` does the expected thing — only giving you back functions, rather than also types.

A similar kind of clash could occur with other functions — for instance, we don't have an `is_array(r)` right now that would check if `r` were the reflection of an array (as opposed to an array type), but we could in the future.

There are a few other examples of name clashes where we want the reflection query to apply to more inputs than simply types. For example, the type trait `std::is_final` can only ask if a type is a final class type, but the metafunction `std::meta::is_final` can ask if a member function is a final member function. Likewise `std::meta::is_const` can apply to objects or types too, and so forth.

The question becomes — how can we incorporate the type traits into the consteval metafunction domain while avoiding these name clash issues. We know of a few approaches.

1. Put all the type traits in their own namespace, like `std::meta::traits::meow`. This has the benefit that we preserve the existing name, but now we lose ADL. We can't write `traits::remove_cvref(type)` unless we bring in `traits` as a namespace alias for `std::meta::traits`, and if we bring in the entire namespace then we're back to the name clash problem (it's just that now the calls become ambiguous).

2. Add a prefix or suffix to every type trait. This preserves the ability to use ADL and makes the new names easy to remember (since `std::meow_v<T>` just directly translates into `std::meta::type_meow(type)` for all `meow`), at the cost of worse names.

3. Do something more tailored on a case-by-case basis.

We don't think the nested namespace approach (#1) is a good idea because of the loss of ADL and the more inconvenient call syntax.

Previous revisions of this proposal used the `type_` prefix (#2) uniformly. This had the downside that some type traits end up reading awkwardly (`type_is_pointer` as opposed to `is_pointer_type`) but several others do read much better (`type_has_virtual_destructor` as opposed to `has_virtual_destructor_type`). Some type traits look equally ridiculous with either a prefix or suffix (`type_common_type` vs `common_type_type`).

A more bespoke approach (#3) would be to do something based on the grammar of the existing type traits:

* All the type traits of the form `is_meow` can become `is_meow_type`. This reads quite nicely for most of them (`is_pointer_type`, `is_trivially_copyable_type`, `is_void_type`, etc.). `is_swappable_with_type` or `is_pointer_convertible_base_of_type` or `is_invocable_type` maybe aren't amazing, but they're not terrible either. There are 76 of these and having a uniform transformation is valuable. We could even simply special case the few that are known to conflict (or, in the case of `is_array`, might conflict in the future, but that's a little harder to internalize).
* The remaining ones could potentially keep their current name in `std::meta::` form as well. There are a few things to point out with these remaining traits though:
  * a couple type transformations like `add_const` could potentially also apply to member functions for the purposes of generating code (although some of these, like `add_lvalue_reference`, we'd want to spell in terms of the qualifier, so those wouldn't conflict). It'd probably be okay to start with an `add_const` that only applies to types and eventually extend it, if we go that route though.
  * `alignment_of` goes away entirely (since we already have `std::meta::alignment_of`). Nobody will notice.
  * a couple of these could meaningfully apply to objects as well as types, like `has_virtual_destructor`, but we would still only apply to types.

Note that either way, we're also including a few common traits that aren't defined in the same places — those are the tuple traits (`tuple_size`/`tuple_element`) and the variant traits (`variant_size`/`variant_alternative`).

Starting from R8, this paper uses option #3. That is: every type trait `std::is_meow` is introduced as `std::meta::is_meow_type`, while all other type traits `std::meow` are introduced as `std::meta::meow`.

## ODR Concerns

Static reflection invariably brings new ways to violate ODR.

```cpp
// File 'cls.h'
struct Cls {
  void odr_violator() {
    if constexpr (members_of(parent_of(^^std::size_t)).size() % 2 == 0)
      branch_1();
    else
      branch_2();
  }
};
```

Two translation units including `cls.h` can generate different definitions of `Cls::odr_violator()` based on whether an odd or even number of declarations have been imported from `std`. Branching on the members of a namespace is dangerous because namespaces may be redeclared and reopened: the set of contained declarations can differ between program points.

The creative programmer will find no difficulty coming up with other predicates which would be similarly dangerous if substituted into the same `if constexpr` condition: for instance, given a branch on `is_complete_type(^^T)`, if one translation unit `#include`s a forward declaration of `T`, another `#include`s a complete definition of `T`, and they both afterwards `#include "cls.h"`, the result will be an ODR violation.

Additional papers are already in flight proposing additional metafunctions that pose similar dangers. For instance, [@P3096R1] proposes the `parameters_of` metafunction. This feature is important for generating language bindings (e.g., Python, JavaScript), but since parameter names can differ between declarations, it would be dangerous for a member function defined in a header file to branch on the name of a parameter.

These cases are not difficult to identify: Given an entity `E` and two program points `P1` and `P2` from which a reflection of `E` may be optained, it is unsafe to branch runtime code generation on any property of `E` (e.g., namespace members, parameter names, completeness of a class) that can be modified between `P1` and `P2`. Worth noting as well, these sharp edges are not unique (or new) to reflection: It is already possible to build an ODR trap based on the completeness of a class using C++23.

Education and training are important to help C++ users avoid such sharp edges, but we do not find them sufficiently concerning to give pause to our enthusiasm for the features proposed by this paper.

# Proposed Wording

[Throughout the wording, we say that a reflection (an object of type `std::meta::info`) *represents* some source construct, while splicing that reflection *designates* that source construct. For instance, `^^int` represents the type `int` and `[: ^^int :]` designates the type `int`.]{.ednote}

## Language

Add `$splice-specifier$` to the list of template argument forms in definition 3.5.

**[3.5]{.pnum} argument**

⟨template instantiation⟩ `$constant-expression$`, `$type-id$`, [or]{.rm} `$id-expression$`[, or `$splice-specifier$`]{.addu} in the comma-separated list bounded by the angle brackets

:::

### [lex.phases]{.sref} Phases of translation {-}

[In addition to changes necessary for this proposal, we are applying the "drive-by fix" of merging phases 7/8, in order to clarify that template instantiation is interleaved with translation. In so doing, we replace the notion of "instantiation units" with a partial ordering among all program constructs in a translation unit.]{.ednote}

Modify the wording for phases 7-8 of [lex.phases]{.sref} as follows:

::: std

[7-8]{.pnum} Whitespace characters separating tokens are no longer significant. Each preprocessing token is converted into a token ([lex.token]{.sref}). The resulting tokens constitute a translation unit and are syntactically and semantically analyzed and translated.

  [The process of analyzing and translating the tokens can occasionally result in one token being replaced by a sequence of other tokens ([temp.names])]{.note3}

  It is implementation-defined whether the sources for module-units and header units on which the current translation unit has an interface dependency ([module.unit]{.sref}, [module.import]{.sref}) are required to be available.

  [Source files, translation units and translated translation units need not necessarily be stored as files, nor need there be any one-to-one correspondence between these entities and any external representation. The description is conceptual only, and does not specify any particular implementation.]{.note}

  [Translated translation units and instantiation units are combined as follows:]{.rm}

  [[Some or all of these can be supplied from a library.]{.note5}]{.rm}

  [Each translated translation unit is examined to produce a list of required instantiations.]{.rm}

  [While the tokens constituting translation units are being analyzed and translated, a collection of required instantiations is produced.]{.addu}

  [This can include instantiations which have been explicitly requested ([temp.explicit]).]{.note5}

  [The contexts from which instantiations may be performed are determined by their respective points of instantiation ([temp.point]{.sref}).]{.addu}

  [[Other requirements in this document can further constrain the  context from which an instantiation can be performed. For example, a constexpr function template specialization might have a point of instantation at the end of a translation unit, but its use in certain constant expressions could require that it be instantiated from an earlier point ([temp.inst]).]{.note}]{.addu}

  The definitions of the required templates are located. It is implementation-defined whether the source of the translation units containing these definitions is required to be available.

  [[An implementation can choose to encode sufficient information into the translated translation unit so as to ensure the source is not required here.]{.note}]{.rm}

  [All required instantiations are perfomed to produce _instantiation units_.]{.rm}

  [[These are similar to translated translation units, but contain no references to uninstantiated templates and no template definitions.]{.note}]{.rm}

  [Each instantiation results in new program constructs.]{.addu} The program is ill-formed if any instantiation fails.

  [Instantiation confers a partition over the program constructs, and the tokens comprising the translation unit furthermore endow the partitioned constructs with a partial order. Two constructs are _semantically sequenced_ if the tokens by which they are described belong to the same translation unit and if either both constructs result from the same instantiation or if neither results from any instantiation. Given two semantically sequenced program constructs, whether one _semantically follows_ the other is determined as follows:]{.addu}

  * [[7.8-1]{.pnum} If both constructs are within the `$member-specification$` of a class `C` ([class.mem.general]{.sref}) and one such construct (call it `$X$`) is in a complete-class context of `C` but the other (call it `$Y$`) is not, then `$X$` semantically follows `$Y$`.]{.addu}
  * [[7-8.#]{.pnum} Otherwise, if the syntactic endpoint of the tokens that describe one such construct (call it `$X$`) occurs lexically after the syntactic endpoint of the tokens that describe the other (call it `$Y$`), then `$X$` semantically follows `$Y$`.]{.addu}

  [During the analysis and translation of tokens and instantiations, certain expressions are evaluated ([expr.const]). Diagnosable rules ([intro.compliance.general]{.sref}) that apply to constructs that semantically follow a plainly constant-evaluated expression `$P$` are considered in a context where `$P$` has been evaluated exactly once.]{.addu}

  [[Other requirements in this document can further constrain the contexts from which expressions are evaluated. For example, a declaration that lexically follows all points from which a given instantiation can be perfomed will be considered in a context where all plainly constant-evaluated expressions resulting from that instantiation have been evaluated exactly once.]{.note}]{.addu}

  [8]{.pnum} All external entity references are resolved. [...]

### [lex.pptoken]{.sref} Preprocessing tokens {-}

Add a bullet after bullet (4.2):

::: std
* [4]{.pnum} If the input stream has been parsed into preprocessing tokens up to a given character:

  * [#.#]{.pnum} ...
  * [#.#]{.pnum} Otherwise, if the next three characters are `<::` and the subsequent character is neither `:` nor `>`, the `<` is treated as a preprocessing token by itself and not as the first character of the alternative token `<:`.
  * [[#.#]{.pnum} Otherwise, if the next three characters are `[::` and the subsequent character is not `:`, or if the next three characters are `[:>`, the `[` is treated as a preprocessing token by itself and not as the first character of the preprocessing token `[:`.]{.addu}

      [[The tokens `[:` and `:]` cannot be composed from digraphs.]{.note}]{.addu}
  * [#.#]{.pnum} ...

### [lex.operators]{.sref} Operators and punctuators {-}

Change the grammar for `$operator-or-punctuator$` in paragraph 1 of [lex.operators]{.sref} to include the reflection operator and the `$splice-specifier$` delimiters:

::: std
```

:::

### [basic.pre]{.sref} Preamble {-}

Add type aliases and namespace aliases to the list of entities in paragraph 3. As drive-by fixes, remove "variable", "object", "reference", and "template specialization"; replace "class member" with "non-static data member", since all other cases are subsumed by existing one. Add "template parameters" and "`$init-capture$`s", which collectively subsume "packs".

::: std
[3]{.pnum} An _entity_ is a [value, object, reference]{.rm} [variable,]{.addu} structured binding, function, enumerator, type, [type alias]{.addu}, [class]{.rm} [non-static data]{.addu} member, bit-field, template, template specialization, namespace, [namespace alias, template parameter]{.addu}, or [`$init-capture$`]{.addu} [pack]{.rm}.

:::

Introduce a notion of an "underlying entity" in paragraph 5, and utilize it for the definition of a name "denoting" an entity. Type aliases are now entities, so also modify accordingly.

::: std
[5]{.pnum} Every name is introduced by a _declaration_, which is a

* [#.#]{.pnum} `$name-declaration$`, `$block-declaration$`, or `$member-declaration$` ([dcl.pre]{.sref}, [class.mem]{.sref}),

[...]

* [#.14]{.pnum} implicit declaration of an injected-class-name ([class.pre]{.sref}).

[The _underlying entity_ of an entity is that entity unless otherwise specified. A name _denotes_ the underlying entity of the entity declared by each declaration that introduces the name.]{.addu} [An entity `$E$` is denoted by the name (if any) that is introduced by a declaration of `$E$` or by a `$typedef-name$` introduced by a declaration specifying `$E$`.]{.rm}

[[Type aliases and namespace aliases are examples of entities whose underlying entities are distinct from themselves.]{.note}]{.addu}
:::

Modify paragraph 6 such that denoting a variable by its name finds the variable, not the associated object.

::: std
[6]{.pnum} A _variable_ is introduced by the declaration of a reference other than a non-static data member or of an object. [The variable's name, if any, denotes the reference or object.]{.rm}
:::

### [basic.def]{.sref} Declarations and definitions {-}

Modify the third sentence of paragraph 1 to clarify that type aliases are now entities.

::: std
[1]{.pnum} [...] A declaration of an entity [or `$typedef-name$`]{.rm} `$X$` is a redeclaration of `$X$` if another declaration of `$X$` is reachable from it ([module.reach]{.sref}). [...]

:::

Since namespace aliases are now entities, but their declarations are not definitions, add `$namespace-alias-definition$` to the list of declarations in paragraph 2, just before `$using-declaration$`:

::: std
[2]{.pnum} Each entity declared by a `$declaration$` is also _defined_ by that declaration unless:

* [#.#]{.pnum} it declares a function without specifying the function's body ([dcl.fct.def]{.sref}),

[...]

* [2.10]{.pnum} it is an `$alias-declaration$` ([dcl.typedef]{.sref}),
* [[2.11-]{.pnum} it is a `$namespace-alias-definition$` ([namespace.alias]{.sref}),]{.addu}
* [2.11]{.pnum} it is a `$using-declaration$` ([namespace.udecl]{.sref}),

[...]

:::

### [basic.def.odr]{.sref} One-definition rule {-}

Add `$splice-expression$`s to the set of potential results of an expression in paragraph 3.

::: std
[3]{.pnum} An expression or conversion is _potentially evaluated_ unless it is an unevaluated operand ([expr.context]), a subexpression thereof, or a conversion in an initialization or conversion sequence in such a context. The set of _potential results_ of an expression `$E$` is defined as follows:

- [#.#]{.pnum} If `$E$` is an `$id-expression$` ([expr.prim.id]{.sref}) [or a `$splice-expression$` ([expr.prim.splice])]{.addu}, the set contains only `$E$`.
- [#.#]{.pnum} [...]

[This set is a (possibly-empty) set of `$id-expression$`s [and `$splice-expression$`s]{.addu}, each of which is either `$E$` or a subexpression of `$E$`.]{.note}

:::

Break bullet 4.1 into sub-bullets, modify it to cover splicing of functions, and replace [basic.lookup] with [over.pre] since the canonical definition of "overload set" is relocated there by this proposal:

::: std
- [4.1]{.pnum} A function is named by an expression or conversion [`$E$`]{.addu} if it is the selected member of an overload set ([[basic.lookup]]{.rm} [[over.pre]]{.addu}, [over.match], [over.over]) in an overload resolution performed as part of forming that expression or conversion, unless it is a pure virtual function and [either the expression]{.rm}[\ ]{.addu}

  - [#.#.#]{.pnum} [`$E$`]{.addu} is not an `$id-expression$` naming the function with an explicitly qualified name[,]{.addu}
  - [[#.#.#]{.pnum} [`$E$`]{.addu} is not a `$splice-expression$`,]{.addu} or
  - [#.#.#]{.pnum} [the expression]{.rm} [`$E$`]{.addu} forms a pointer to member ([expr.unary.op]).

:::

Modify the first sentence of paragraph 5 to cover splicing of variables:

::: std
- [5]{.pnum} A variable is named by an expression if the expression is an `$id-expression$` [or `$splice-expression$` ([expr.prim.splice])]{.addu} that designates it.
:::

Modify paragraph 6 to cover splicing of structured bindings:

::: std
- [6]{.pnum} A structured binding is [odr-used if it appears as a potentially-evaluated]{.rm} [named by an]{.addu} expression [if that expression is either an]{.addu} `$id-expression$` [or a `$splice-expression$` that designates that structured binding. A structured binding is odr-used if it is named by a potentially-evaluated expression.]{.addu}

:::

Prepend before paragraph 15 of [basic.def.odr]{.sref}:

::: std

::: addu
[15pre]{.pnum} If a class `C` is defined in a translation unit as a result of a call to a specialization of `std::meta::define_aggregate` and another translation unit contains a definition of `C` that is not a result of calling the same specialization with the same function arguments, the program is ill-formed; a diagnostic is required only if `C` is attached to a named module and a prior definition is reachable at the point where a later definition occurs.

:::


[15]{.pnum} For any [other]{.addu} definable item `D` with definitions in multiple translation units,

* if `D` is a non-inline non-templated function or variable, or
* if the definitions in different translation units do not satisfy the following requirements,

the program is ill-formed; a diagnostic is required only if the definable item is attached to a named module and a prior definition is reachable at the point where a later definition occurs. [...]
:::

Prefer the verb "denote" in bullet 15.5 to emphasize that ODR "looks through" aliases, and clarify that objects are not entities in bullet 15.5.2.

::: std
- [15.5]{.pnum} In each such definition, corresponding names, looked up according to [basic.lookup]{.sref}, shall [refer to]{.rm} [denote]{.addu} the same entity, after overload resolution ([over.match]{.sref}) and after matching of partial template specialization ([temp.over]{.sref}), except that a name can refer to
  - [#.#.#]{.pnum} a non-volatile const object [...], or
  - [#.#.#]{.pnum} a reference with internal or no linkage initialized with a constant expression such that the reference refers to the same [entity]{.rm} [object or function]{.addu} in all definitions of `$D$`.

:::

Clarify in bullet 15.11 that default template-arguments in `$splice-specialization-specifier$`s also factor into ODR.

::: std
- [15.10]{.pnum} In each such definition, the overloaded operators referred to, the implicit calls to conversion functions, constructors, operator new functions and operator delete functions, shall refer to the same function.
- [15.11]{.pnum} In each such definition, a default argument used by an (implicit or explicit) function call or a default template argument used by an (implicit or explicit) `$template-id$`[,]{.addu} [or]{.rm} `$simple-template-id$`[, or `$splice-specialization-specifier$`]{.addu} is treated as if its token sequence were present in the definition of `$D$`; that is, the default argument or default template argument is subject to the requirements described in this paragraph (recursively).

:::

And add a bullet thereafter that factors the result of a `$reflect-expression$` into ODR.

::: std
::: addu
- [15.11+]{.pnum} In each such definition, corresponding `$reflect-expression$`s ([expr.reflect]) compute equivalent values ([expr.eq]{.sref}).

### [basic.scope.scope]{.sref} General {-}

Change bullet 4.2 to refer to the declaration of a "type alias" instead of a `$typedef-name$`.

::: std
[4.2]{.pnum} one declares a type (not a [`$typedef-name$`]{.rm} [type alias]{.addu}) and the other declares a variable, non-static data member other than an anonymous union ([class.union.anon]{.sref}), enumerator, function, or function template, or

### [basic.lookup.general]{.sref} General {-}

Modify paragraph 1 to cross-reference to the new definition of "overload set" given in [over.pre], rather than define it here.

::: std
[1]{.pnum} [...] If the declarations found by name lookup all denote functions or function templates, the declarations [are said to]{.rm} form an [_overload set_]{.rm} [overload set ([over.pre]{.sref})]{.addu}. Otherwise, [...]

:::

Adjust the definition in paragraph 2 of when a program point follows a declaration to account for the removal of instantiation units.

::: std
[2]{.pnum} A program point `$P$` is said to follow any declaration [with which it is semantically sequenced ([lex.phases]{.sref})]{.addu} [in the same translation unit]{.rm} whose locus ([basic.scope.pdecl]{.sref}) is before `$P$`.
:::

Adjust paragraph 4 since type aliases are now entities.

::: std
[4]{.pnum} In certain contexts, only certain kinds of declarations are included. After any such restriction, any declarations of classes or enumerations are discarded if any other declarations are found.

[A type (but not a [`$typedef-name$`]{.rm} [type alias]{.addu} or template) is therefore hidden by any other entity in its scope.]{.note4}

However, if lookup is _type-only_, only declarations of types and templates whose specializations are types are considered; furthermore, if declarations of a [`$typedef-name$`]{.rm} [type alias]{.addu} and of [the type to which it refers]{.rm} [its underlying entity]{.addu} are found, the declaration of the [`$typedef-name$`]{.rm} [type alias]{.addu} is discarded instead of the type declaration.

### [basic.lookup.argdep]{.sref} Argument-dependent name lookup {-}

Modify the first bullet of paragraph 3 of [basic.lookup.argdep]{.sref} as follows:

### [basic.lookup.qual.general]{.sref} General {-}

Extend paragraph 1 to cover `$splice-specifier$`s:

::: std
[1]{.pnum} Lookup of an *identifier* followed by a `::` scope resolution operator considers only namespaces, types, and templates whose specializations are types. If a name, `$template-id$`, [`$splice-scope-specifier$`,]{.addu} or `$computed-type-specifier$` is followed by a `::`, it shall [either be a dependent `$splice-scope-specifier$` ([temp.dep.splice]) or it shall]{.addu} designate a namespace, class, enumeration, or dependent type, and the `::` is never interpreted as a complete nested-name-specifier.

### [basic.fundamental]{.sref} Fundamental types {-}

Add a new paragraph before the last paragraph of [basic.fundamental]{.sref} as follows:

::: std
::: addu

[17 - 1]{.pnum} A value of type `std::meta::info` is called a _reflection_. There exists a unique _null reflection_; every other reflection is a representation of

* a value of structural type ([temp.param]{.sref}),
* an object with static storage duration ([basic.stc]{.sref}),
* a variable ([basic.pre]{.sref}),
* a structured binding ([dcl.struct.bind]{.sref}),
* a function,
* an enumerator ([dcl.enum]{.sref}),
* a type alias ([dcl.typedef]{.sref}),
* a type,
* a class member ([class.mem]{.sref}),
* an unnamed bit-field ([class.bit]{.sref}),
* a primary class template ([temp.pre]{.sref}),
* a function template ([temp.pre]{.sref}),
* a primary variable template ([temp.pre]{.sref}),
* an alias template ([temp.alias]{.sref}),
* a concept ([temp.concept]{.sref}),
* a namespace alias ([namespace.alias]{.sref}),
* a namespace ([basic.namespace.general]{.sref}),
* a direct base class relationship ([class.derived.general]{.sref}), or
* a data member description ([class.mem.general]{.sref}).

An expression convertible to a reflection is said to _represent_ the corresponding construct. `sizeof(std::meta::info)` shall be equal to `sizeof(void*)`.

::: example
```cpp
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3};
auto [a1, a2, a3] = arr;
void fn();
enum Enum { A };
using Alias = int;
struct B {};
struct S : B {

template <auto> int TVar;
template <auto> concept Concept = requires { true; };
namespace NS {};
namespace NSAlias = NS;

constexpr auto r1 = std::meta::reflect_value(42);  // represents int value of 42

constexpr auto r2 = std::meta::reflect_object(arr[1]);  // represents int object

constexpr auto r3 = ^^arr;      // represents a variable
constexpr auto r4 = ^^a3;       // represents a structured binding
constexpr auto r5 = ^^fn;       // represents a function

constexpr auto r10 = std::meta::members_of(^^S)[1];
    // represents an unnamed bit-field

constexpr auto r11 = ^^TCls;     // represents a class template
constexpr auto r12 = ^^TFn;      // represents a function template
constexpr auto r13 = ^^TVar;     // represents a variable template
constexpr auto r14 = ^^Concept;  // represents a concept
constexpr auto r15 = ^^NSAlias;  // represents a namespace alias
constexpr auto r16 = ^^NS;       // represents a namespace

constexpr auto r17 = std::meta::bases_of(^^S)[0];
    // represents a direct base class relationship

constexpr auto r18 = std::meta::data_member_spec(^^int, {.name="member"});
    // represents a data member description

In the following contexts, [an]{.rm} [a (possibly parenthesized)]{.addu} `$id-expression$` [or `$splice-expression$` ([expr.prim.splice]) `$E$`]{.addu} is _move-eligible_:

Add a paragraph after paragraph 1 specifying the rules for parsing a `$splice-scope-specifier$`, as well as an example:

::: std
::: addu
[1+]{.pnum} A `$splice-specifier$` or `$splice-specialization-specifier$` that is not followed by `::` is never interpreted as part of a `$splice-scope-specifier$`. The `template` may only be omitted from the form `template@~_opt_~@ $splice-specialization-specifier$ ::` when the `$splice-specialization-specifier$` is preceded by `typename`.

[#]{.pnum} A `$reflect-expression$` of the form `^^ $id-expression$` is interpreted as follows:

  * [#.#]{.pnum} If the `$id-expression$` denotes an overload set `$S$` and overload resolution for the expression `&$S$` determines a unique function `$F$` ([over.over]{.sref}), the `$reflect-expression$` represents `$F$`.

[2]{.pnum} The converted operands shall have arithmetic, enumeration, pointer, or pointer-to-member type, [type `std::meta::info`,]{.addu} or type `std::nullptr_t`. The operators `==` and `!=` both yield `true` or `false`, i.e., a result of type `bool`. In each case below, the operands shall have the same type after the specified conversions have been applied.

:::

Add a new paragraph between paragraphs 5 and 6:

::: std
[5]{.pnum} Two operands of type `std::nullptr_t` or one operand of type `std::nullptr_t` and the other a null pointer constant compare equal.

::: addu
[5+]{.pnum} If both operands are of type `std::meta::info`, comparison is defined as follows:

* [5+.#]{.pnum} If one operand is a null reflection value, then they compare equal if and only if the other operand is also a null reflection value.
* [5+.#]{.pnum} Otherwise, if one operand represents a value, then they compare equal if and only if the other operand represents a value that is template-argument-equivalent ([temp.type]{.sref}).
* [5+.#]{.pnum} Otherwise, if one operand represents an object, then they compare equal if and only if the other operand represents the same object.
* [5+.#]{.pnum} Otherwise, if one operand represents an entity, then they compare equal if and only if the other operand represents the same entity.
* [5+.#]{.pnum} Otherwise, if one operand represents a direct base class relationship, then they compare equal if and only if the other operand represents the same direct base class relationship.
* [5+.#]{.pnum} Otherwise, both operands `O@~_1_~@` and `O@~_2_~@` represent data member descriptions. The operands compare equal if and only if the data member descriptions represented by `O@~_1_~@` and `O@~_2_~@` compare equal ([class.mem.general]{.sref}).
:::

[6]{.pnum} If two operands compare equal, the result is `true` for the `==` operator and `false` for the `!=` operator. If two operands compare unequal, the result is `false` for the `==` operator and `true` for the `!=` operator. Otherwise, the result of each of the operators is unspecified.

### [expr.const]{.sref} Constant Expressions {-}

Modify paragraph 10 to mention `$splice-expression$`s:

::: std

[21pre]{.pnum} A non-dependent expression or conversion is _plainly constant-evaluated_ if it is not in a complete-class context ([class.mem.general]{.sref}) and is either

* [21pre.#]{.pnum} the `$constant-expression$` of a `$static_assert-declaration$` ([dcl.pre]{.sref}), or

[The evaluation of a plainly constant-evaluated expression `$E$` can produce injected declarations (see below) and happens exactly once ([lex.phases]{.sref}). Any such declarations are reachable from a point that follows immediately after `$E$`.]{.note}

:::
:::

Add a note following the definition of _manifestly constant-evaluated_ to clarify the relationship with _plainly constant-evaluated_ expressions:

::: std

[21]{.pnum} An expression or conversion is _manifestly constant-evaluated_ if it is:

* [#.#]{.pnum} a `$constant-expression$`, or
* [#.#]{.pnum} the condition of a constexpr if statement ([stmt.if]{.sref}), or
* [#.#]{.pnum} an immediate invocation, or
* [#.#]{.pnum} the result of substitution into an atomic constraint expression to determine whether it is satisfied ([temp.constr.atomic]{.sref}), or
* [#.#]{.pnum} the initializer for a variable that is usable in constant expressions or has constant initialization ([basic.start.static]{.sref}).

::: addu
[All plainly constant-evaluated expressions are manifestly constant-evaluated, but some manifestly constant-evaluated expressions (e.g., template arguments) are not plainly constant-evaluated. Such expressions are still evaluated during translation, but (unlike plainly constant-evaluated expressions) can be evaluated multiple times, and there are no constraints on the relative order of their evaluation.]{.note}
:::

:::

After the example following the definition of _manifestly constant-evaluated_, introduce new terminology and rules for injecting declarations and renumber accordingly:

::: std
::: addu

[#]{.pnum} The evaluation of an expression can introduce one or more _injected declarations_. Each such declaration has an associated _synthesized point_ which follows the last non-synthesized program point in the translation unit containing that declaration. The evaluation is said to _produce_ the declaration.

[Special rules concerning reachability apply to synthesized points ([module.reach]{.sref}).]{.note13}

[#]{.pnum} The program is ill-formed if the evaluation of a manifestly constant-evaluated expression `$M$` produces an injected declaration `$D$` and either

* [#.#]{.pnum} `$M$` is not a plainly constant-evaluated expression, or
* [#.#]{.pnum} the target scope of `$D$` is not semantically sequenced with `$M$` ([lex.phases]{.sref}).

Furthermore, the program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required, if

* [#.#]{.pnum} an evaluation `$E$@~_1_~@` produces an injected declaration `$D$` during the evaluation of a manifestly constant-evaluated expression `$M$`,
* [#.#]{.pnum} a second evaluation `$E$@~_2_~@` computes a reflection of `$D$` during the same evaluation of `$M$`, and
* [#.#]{.pnum} `$E$@~_1_~@` is unsequenced with `$E$@~_2_~@` ([intro.execution]).

::: example
```cpp
consteval bool make_decl(int);      // calling 'make_decl(n)' produces an injected
                                    // declaration in the global namespace

constexpr bool b1 = !make_decl(1);  // OK, constexpr variable so this is plainly
                                    // constant evaluated

bool b2 = !make_decl(2);
  // error: initializer !make_decl(42) produced an injected declaration but is

[#]{.pnum} The _evaluation context_ is a set of points within the program that determines the behavior of certain functions used for reflection ([meta.reflection]).

### [dcl.pre]{.sref} Preamble {-}

Strike the assertion that a `$typedef-name$` is synonymous with its associated type from paragraph 8 (type aliases are entities now).

::: std
[8]{.pnum} If the `$decl-specifier-seq$` contains the `typedef` specifier, the declaration is a _typedef declaration_ and each `$declarator-id$` is declared to be a `$typedef-name$`[, synonymous with its associated type]{.rm} ([dcl.typedef]{.sref}).

:::

### [dcl.typedef]{.sref} The `typedef` specifier {-}

Modify paragraphs 1-2 to clarify that the `typedef` specifier now introduces an entity.

::: std
[1]{.pnum} Declarations containing the `$decl-specifier$` `typedef` declare [identifiers that can be used later for naming]{.rm} [type aliases whose underlying entities are]{.addu} fundamental ([basic.fundamental]{.sref}) or compound ([basic.compound]{.sref}) types. The `typedef` specifier shall not be combined in a `$decl-specifier-seq$` with any other kind of specifier except a `$defining-type-specifier$`, and it shall not be used in the `$decl-specifier-seq$` of a `$parameter-declaration$` ([dcl.fct]{.sref}) nor in the `$decl-specifier-seq$` of a `$function-definition$` ([dcl.fct.def]{.sref}). If a `$typedef-specifier$` appears in a declaration without a `$declarator$`, the program is ill-formed.

```
  $typedef-name$:
      $identifier$
      $simple-template-id$
```

A name declared with the `typedef` specifier becomes a `$typedef-name$`. [A `$typedef-name$` names]{.rm} [The underlying entity of the type alias is the]{.addu} type associated with the `$identifier$` ([dcl.decl]{.sref}) or `$simple-template-id$` ([temp.pre]{.sref}); a `$typedef-name$` [is]{.rm} thus [a synonym for]{.rm} [denotes]{.addu} another type. A `$typedef-name$` does not introduce a new type the way a class declaration ([class.name]{.sref}) or enum declaration ([dcl.enum]{.sref}) does.

[2]{.pnum} A [`$typedef-name$`]{.rm} [type alias]{.addu} can also be [introduced]{.rm} [declared]{.addu} by an `$alias-declaration$`. The `$identifier$` following the `using` keyword is not looked up; it becomes [a]{.rm} [the]{.addu} `$typedef-name$` [of a type alias]{.addu} and the optional `$attribute-specifier-seq$` following the `$identifier$` appertains to that [`$typedef-name$`]{.rm} [type alias]{.addu}. Such a [`$typedef-name$`]{.rm} [type alias]{.addu} has the same semantics as if it were introduced by the `typedef` specifier. In particular, it does not define a new type.

Add a bullet to paragraph 9 of [dcl.fct]{.sref} to allow for reflections of abominable function types:

::: std
[9]{.pnum} A function type with a `$cv-qualifier-seq$` or a `$ref-qualifier$` (including a type named by `$typedef-name$` ([dcl.typedef], [temp.param])) shall appear only as:

* [#.#]{.pnum} the function type for a non-static member function,
* [#.#]{.pnum} the function type to which a pointer to member refers,
* [#.#]{.pnum} the top-level function type of a function typedef declaration or `$alias-declaration$`,
* [#.#]{.pnum} the `$type-id$` in the default argument of a `$type-parameter$` ([temp.param]),
* [#.#]{.pnum} the `$type-id$` of a `$template-argument$` for a `$type-parameter$` ([temp.arg.type])[.]{.rm}[, or]{.addu}

::: addu
* [9.6]{.pnum} the operand of a `$reflect-expression$` ([expr.reflect]).

### [dcl.fct.def.delete]{.sref} Deleted definitions {-}

Change paragraph 2 of [dcl.fct.def.delete]{.sref} to allow for reflections of deleted functions:

::: std

[2]{.pnum} A program that refers to a deleted function implicitly or explicitly, other than to declare it [or to use as the operand of a `$reflect-expression$` ([expr.reflect])]{.addu}, is ill-formed.
:::

### [enum.udecl]{.sref} The `using enum` declaration {-}

Extend the grammar for `$using-enum-declarator$` as follows:

::: std
```diff
  $using-enum-declaration$:
     using enum $using-enum-declarator$ ;

     $nested-name-specifier$@~_opt_~@ $simple-template-id$

:::

Modify paragraph 1 to handle `$splice-type-specifier$`s:

::: std

[1]{.pnum} [A `$using-enum-declarator$` of the form `$splice-type-specifier$` designates the same construct designated by the `$splice-type-specifier$`. Any other]{.addu} [A]{.rm} `$using-enum-declarator$` names the set of declarations found by type-only lookup ([basic.lookup.general]) for the `$using-enum-declarator$` ([basic.lookup.unqual]{.sref}, [basic.lookup.qual]{.sref}). The `$using-enum-declarator$` shall designate a non-dependent type with a reachable `$enum-specifier$`.
:::

### [namespace.alias]{.sref} Namespace alias {-}

Modify the grammar for `$namespace-alias-definition$` in paragraph 1, and clarify that such declarations declare a "namespace alias" (which is now an entity as per [basic.pre]).

::: std
[1]{.pnum} A `$namespace-alias-definition$` declares [an alternative name for a namespace]{.rm} [a namespace alias]{.addu} according to the following grammar:

```diff
  $namespace-alias$:
      $identifier$

  $namespace-alias-definition$:
      namespace $identifier$ = $qualified-namespace-specifier$

  $qualified-namespace-specifier$:
      $nested-name-specifier$@~_opt_~@ $namespace-name$
```

[The `$splice-specifier$` (if any) shall designate a namespace.]{.addu}
:::

Remove the details about what the `$namespace-alias$` denotes; this will fall out from the "underlying entity" of the namespace alias defined below:

::: std
[2]{.pnum} The `$identifier$` in a `$namespace-alias-definition$` becomes a `$namespace-alias$` [and denotes the namespace denoted by the `$qualified-namespace-specifier$`]{.rm}.

:::

Add the following paragraph after paragraph 2 and before the note:

::: std
::: addu
[2+]{.pnum} The underlying entity ([basic.pre]{.sref}) of the namespace alias is the namespace either denoted by the `$qualified-namespace-specifier$` or designated by the `$splice-specifier$`.

:::
:::

### [namespace.udir]{.sref} Using namespace directive {-}

Add `$splice-specifier$` to the grammar for `$using-directive$`:

::: std
```diff
  $using-directive$:
      $attribute-specifier-seq$@~_opt_~@ using namespace $nested-name-specifier$@~_opt_~@ $namespace-name$
+     $attribute-specifier-seq$@~_opt_~@ using namespace $splice-specifier$
```
:::

Add the following prior to the first paragraph of [namespace.udir]{.sref}, and renumber accordingly:

::: std
::: addu
[0]{.pnum} The `$splice-specifier$`, if any, designates a namespace. The `$nested-name-specifier$` and the `$splice-specifier$` shall not be dependent.
:::

[1]{.pnum} A `$using-directive$` shall not appear in class scope, but may appear in namespace scope or in block scope.

[...]
:::

Prefer the verb "designate" rather than "nominate" in the notes that follow:

::: std
[A `$using-directive$` makes the names in the [nominated]{.rm} [designated]{.addu} namespace usable in the scope [...]. During unqualified name lookup, the names appear as if they were declared in the nearest enclosing namespace which contains both the `$using-directive$` and the [nomindated]{.rm} [designated]{.addu} namespace.]{.note2}

[...]

[A `$using-directive$` is transitive: if a scope contains a `$using-directive$` that [nominates]{.rm} [designates]{.addu} a namespace that itself contains `$using-directives$`, the namespaces [nominated]{.rm} [designated]{.addu} by those `$using-directives$` are also eligible to be considered.]{.note4}
:::


### [dcl.attr.grammar]{.sref} Attribute syntax and semantics {-}

Add a production to the grammar for `$attribute-specifier$` as follows:

::: std
```diff
  $attribute-specifier$:
     [ [ $attribute-using-prefix$@~_opt_~@ $attribute-list$ ] ]
+    [ [ using $attribute-namespace$ :] ]
     $alignment-specifier$
```
:::

and update the grammar for balanced token as follows:

::: std
```diff
  $balanced-token$ :
      ( $balanced-token-seq$@~_opt_~@ )
      [ $balanced-token-seq$@~_opt_~@ ]
      { $balanced-token-seq$@~_opt_~@ }
-     any token other than a parenthesis, a bracket, or a brace
+     [: $balanced-token-seq$@~_opt_~@ :]
+     any token other than (, ), [, ], {, }, [:, or :]
```
:::

Change a sentence in paragraph 4 of [dcl.attr.grammar]{.sref} as follows:

::: std

[4]{.pnum} [...] An `$attribute-specifier$` that contains no `$attribute$`s [and no `$alignment-specifier$`]{.addu} has no effect. [[That includes an `$attribute-specifier$` of the form `[ [ using $attribute-namespace$ :] ]` which is thus equivalent to replacing the `:]` token by the two-token sequence `:` `]`.]{.note}]{.addu} ...

### [dcl.attr.deprecated]{.sref} Deprecated attribute {-}

Prefer "type alias" to "`$typedef-name$`" in paragraph 2.

::: std
[2]{.pnum} The attribute may be applied to the declaration of a class, a [`$typedef-name$`]{.rm} [type alias]{.addu}, a variable, a non-static data member, a function, a namespace, an enumeration, an enumerator, a concept, or a template specialization.

:::

### [dcl.attr.unused]{.sref} Maybe unused attribute {-}

Prefer "type alias" to "`$typedef-name$`" in paragraph 2.

::: std
[2]{.pnum} The attribute may be applied to the declaration of a class, [`$typedef-name$`]{.rm} [type alias]{.addu}, variable (including a structured binding declaration), structured binding, non-static data member, function, enumeration, or enumerator, or to an `$identifier$` label ([stmt.label]{.sref}).
:::

### [module.global.frag]{.sref} Global module fragment {-}

Extend bullet 3.1 to include `$splice-specifier$`s that designate `$D$`. Separately account for `$splice-specifier$`s that might have a `$splice-specialization-specifier$` designating a specialization.

::: std
[3]{.pnum} A declaration `$D$` is _decl-reachable_ from a declaration `$S$` in the same translation unit if

- [#.#]{.pnum} `$D$` does not declare a function or function template and `$S$` contains an `$id-expression$`, `$namespace-name$`, `$type-name$`, `$template-name$`, or `$concept-name$` naming `$D$` [or a `$splice-specifier$` or `$splice-expression$` designating `$D$`]{.addu}, or
- [#.#]{.pnum} [...]

:::

Specify in paragraph 3 that it is unspecified whether spliced types are replaced by their designated types, and renumber accordingly. Add an additional bullet further clarifying that it is unspecified whether any splice specifier is replaced.

::: std
In this determination, it is unspecified

- [3.6]{.pnum} whether a reference to an `$alias-declaration$`, `typedef` declaration, `$using-declaration$`, or `$namespace-alias-definition$` is replaced by the declarations they name prior to this determination,
- [#.#]{.pnum} whether a `$simple-template-id$` that does not denote a dependent type and whose `$template-name$` names an alias template is replaced by its denoted type prior to this determination,

- [#.#]{.pnum} whether a non-value-dependent constant expression is replaced by the result of constant evaluation prior to this determination[.]{.rm}[, and]{.addu}
- [[#.#]{.pnum} whether a `$splice-specifier$` that is not dependent is replaced by the construct that it designates prior to this determination.]{.addu}

:::

### [module.reach]{.sref} Reachability {-}

Modify the definition of reachability to account for injected declarations:

::: std
[3]{.pnum} A declaration `$D$` is _reachable from_ a point `$P$` if

* [#.#]{.pnum} [`$P$` is not a synthesized point and]{.addu} `$D$` appears prior to `$P$` in the same translation unit, [or]{.rm}
* [#.#]{.pnum} [`$D$` is an injected declaration for which `$P$` is the corresponding synthesized point, or]{.addu}
* [#.#]{.pnum} `$D$` is not discarded ([module.global.frag]{.sref}), appears in a translation unit that is reachable from `$P$`, and does not appear within a _private-module-fragment_.
:::

### [class.mem.general]{.sref} General {-}

Extend paragraph 5, and modify note 3, to clarify the existence of subobjects corresponding to non-static data members of reference types.

::: std
[5]{.pnum} A data member or member function may be declared `static` in its _member-declaration_, in which case it is a _static member_ (see [class.static]{.sref}) (a _static data member_ ([class.static.data]{.sref}) or _static member function_ ([class.static.mfct]{.sref}), respectively) of the class. Any other data member or member function is a _non-static member_ (a _non-static data member_ or _non-static member function_ ([class.mfct.non.static]{.sref}), respectively). [For each non-static data member of reference type, there is a unique member subobject whose size and alignment is the same as if the data member were declared with the corresponding pointer type.]{.addu}

[[A non-static data member of non-reference type is a member subobject of a class object.]{.rm} [An object of class type has a member subobject corresponding to each non-static data member of its class.]{.addu}]{.note3}

:::

Add a new paragraph to the end of the section defining _data member description_:

::: std
::: addu
[29+]{.pnum} A _data member description_ is a quintuple (`$T$`, `$N$`, `$A$`, `$W$`, `$NUA$`) describing the potential declaration of a nonstatic data member where

- [29+.#]{.pnum} `$T$` is a type or type alias,
- [29+.#]{.pnum} `$N$` is an `$identifier$` or `-1`,
- [29+.#]{.pnum} `$A$` is an alignment or `-1`,
- [29+.#]{.pnum} `$W$` is a bit-field width or `-1`, and
- [29+.#]{.pnum} `$NUA$` is a boolean value.

Two data member descriptions are equal if each of their respective components are same types, same identifiers, and equal values.

::: note
The components of a data member description describe a data member such that

- [29+.#]{.pnum} its type is specified using the type or type alias given by `$T$`,
- [29+.#]{.pnum} it is declared with the name given by `$N$` if `$N$ != -1` and is otherwise unnamed,
- [29+.#]{.pnum} it is declared with the `$alignment-specifier$` ([dcl.align]{.sref}) given by `alignas($A$)` if `$A$ != -1` and is otherwise declared without an `$alignment-specifier$`,
- [29+.#]{.pnum} it is a bit-field ([class.bit]{.sref}) with the width given by `$W$` if `$W$ != -1` and is otherwise not a bit-field,
- [29+.#]{.pnum} it is declared with the attribute `[[no_unique_address]]` ([dcl.attr.nouniqueaddr]{.sref}) if `$NUA$` is `true` and is otherwise declared without that attribute.

Data member descriptions are represented by reflections ([basic.fundamental]{.sref}) returned by `std::meta::data_member_spec` ([meta.reflection.define.aggregate]) and can be reified as data members of a class using `std::meta::define_aggregate` ([meta.reflection.define.aggregate]).

### [class.derived.general]{.sref} General {-}

Introduce the term "direct base class relationship" to paragraph 2.

[2]{.pnum} The component names of a `$class-or-decltype$` are those of its `$nested-name-specifier$`, `$type-name$`, and/or `$simple-template-id$`. A `$class-or-decltype$` shall denote a (possily cv-qualified) class type that is not an incompletely defined class ([class.mem]{.sref}); any cv-qualifiers are ignored. The class denoted by the `$class-or-decltype$` of a `$base-specifier$` is called a _direct base class_ for the class being defined[; each such `$base-specifier$` introduces a _direct base class relationship_ between the class being defined and the direct base class]{.addu}. The lookup for the component name of the `$type-name$` or `$simple-template-id$` is type-only ([basic.lookup]{.sref}). [...]

### [class.access.general]{.sref} General {-}

Prefer "type alias" rather than `$typedef-name$` in the note that follows paragraph 4.

::: std
[Because access control applies to the declarations named, if access control is applied to a [`$typedef-name$`]{.rm} [type alias]{.addu}, only the accessibility of the typedef or alias declaration itself is considered. The accessibility of the [entity referred to by the `$typedef-name$`]{.rm} [underlying entity]{.addu} is not considered.]{.note3}
:::

### [over.pre]{.sref} Preamble {-}

Move the definition "overload set" from [basic.lookup]{.sref} to paragraph 2, rewrite the preamble to better describe overload resolution, and add a note explaining the expressions that form overload sets.

::: std
[2]{.pnum} [An _overload set_ is a set of declarations that each denote a function or function template. Using these declarations as a starting point, the process of _overload resolution_ attempts to determine]{.addu} [When a function is named in a call,]{.rm} which function [declaration]{.rm} is being referenced [and the validity of the call are determined]{.rm} by comparing the types of the arguments at [the]{.rm} [a]{.addu} point of use with the types of the parameters in [candidate functions]{.addu} [in the declarations in the overload set]{.rm}. [This function selection process is called _overload resolution_ and]{.rm} [Overload resolution]{.addu} is defined in [over.match].

  [[Overload sets are formed by `$id-expression$`s naming functions and function templates and by `$splice-expression$`s designating entities of the same kinds.]{.note}]{.addu}

:::

### [over.match.general]{.sref} General {-}

Modify paragraphs 3 and 4 to clarify that access rules do not apply in all contexts.

::: std
[3]{.pnum} If a best viable function exists and is unique, overload resolution succeeds and produces it as the result. Otherwise overload resolution fails and the invocation is ill-formed. When overload resolution succeeds, and the best viable function is [not]{.rm} [neither designated in a manner exempt from access rules nor]{.addu} accessible in the context in which it is used, the program is ill-formed.

[4]{.pnum} Overload resolution results in a _usable candidate_ if overload resolution succeeds and the selected candidate is either not a function ([over.built]{.sref}), or is a function that is not deleted and is [either designated in a manner exempt from access rules or is]{.addu} accessible from the context in which overload resolution was performed.

:::

### [over.call.func]{.sref} Call to named function {-}

Modify paragraph 1 to clarify that this section will also apply to splices of function templates.

::: std
[1]{.pnum} Of interest in [over.call.func] are only those function calls in which the `$posfix-expression$` ultimately contains an `$id-expression$` [or `$splice-expression$`]{.addu} that denotes one or more functions [or function templates]{.addu}. Such a `$postfix-expression$`, perhaps nested arbitrarily deep in parentheses, has one of the following forms:

```diff
  $postfix-expression$:
     $postfix-expression$ . $id-expression$
+    $postfix-expression$ . $splice-expression$
     $postfix-expression$ -> $id-expression$
+    $postfix-expression$ -> $splice-expression$
     $primary-expression$
```

These represent two syntactic subcategories of function calls: qualified function calls and unqualified function calls.

:::

Modify paragraph 2 to account for overload resolution of `$splice-expression$`s designating member function templates.

::: std
[2]{.pnum} In qualified function calls, the function is [named]{.rm} [designated]{.addu} by an `$id-expression$` [or `$splice-expression$`]{.addu} preceded by an `->` or `.` operator. Since the construct `A->B` is generally equivalent to `(*A).B`, the rest of [over] assumes, without loss of generality, that all member function calls have been normalized to the form that uses an object and the `.` operator. Furthermore, [over] assumes that the `$postfix-expression$` that is the left operand of the `.` operator has type "_cv_ `T`" where `T` denotes a class.^102^ The [set of]{.addu} function [or function template]{.addu} declarations [constituting the candidate functions is]{.addu} found by name lookup ([class.member.lookup]{.sref}) [if the `.` is followed by an `$id-expression$` and is otherwise the singleton containing the function or function template designated by the `$splice-expression$`]{.addu} [constitute the set of candidate functions]{.rm}. The argument list is the `$expression-list$` in the call augmented by the addition of the left operand of the `.` operator in the normalized member function call as the implied object argument ([over.match.funcs]{.sref}).

:::

Modify paragraph 3 to account for overload resolution of `$splice-expression$`s designating non-member function templates.

::: std
[3]{.pnum} In unqualified function calls, the function is named by a `$primary-expression$`. [If that `$primary-expression$` is a `$splice-expression$`, then the set of function or function template declarations constituting the candidate functions is the singleton containing the function or function template designated by that `$splice-expression$`. For all other cases, the]{.addu} [The]{.rm} function declarations found by name lookup ([basic.lookup]{.sref}) constitute the set of candidate functions. Because of the rules for name lookup, the set of candidate functions consists either entirely of non-member functions or entirely of member functions of some class `T`. In the former case or if the `$primary-expression$` is [a `$splice-expression$` or]{.addu} the address of an overload set, the argument list is the same as the `$expression-list$` in the call. Otherwise, the argument list is the `$expression-list$` in the call augmented by the addition of an implied function argument as in a qualified function call. If the current class is, or is derived from, `T`, and the keyword `this` ([expr.prim.this]{.sref}) refers to it, then the implied object argument is `(*this)`. Otherwise, a contrived object of type `T` becomes the implied object argument;^103^ if overload resolution selects a non-static member function, the call is ill-formed.

### [over.match.class.deduct]{.sref} Class template argument deduction {-}

Extend paragraph 1 to work with `$splice-type-specifier$`s.

::: std
[1]{.pnum} When resolving a placeholder for a deduced class type ([dcl.type.class.deduct]{.sref}) where the `$template-name$` [or `$splice-type-specifier$`]{.addu} [names]{.rm} [designates]{.addu} a primary class template `C`, a set of functions and function templates, called the guides of `C`, is formed comprising:

### [over.over]{.sref} Address of an overload set

Remove the explicit references to `$id-expression$`s from paragraph 1 to allow taking the address of an overload set specified by a `$splice-expression$`:

::: std
[1]{.pnum} An [`$id-expression$` whose terminal name refers]{.rm} [expression that designates]{.addu} to an overload set `$S$` and that appears without arguments is resolved to a function, a pointer to function, or a pointer to member function for a specific function that is chosen from a set of functions selected from `$S$` determined based on the target type required in the context (if any), as described below. [...]

The [`$id-expression$`]{.rm} [expression]{.addu} can be preceded by the `&` operator.

### [temp.param]{.sref} Template parameters {-}

Clarify that the `>` disambiguation in paragraph 4 also applies to the parsing of `$splice-specialization-specifier$`s:

::: std
[4]{.pnum} When parsing a `$template-argument-list$`, the first non-nested `>`^111^ is taken as the ending delimiter rather than a greater-than operator. Similarly, the first non-nested `>>` is treated as two consecutive but distinct `>` tokens, the first of which is taken as the end of the `$template-argument-list$` and completes the `$template-id$` [or `$splice-specialization-specifier$`]{.addu}.

### [temp.arg.general]{.sref} General {-}

Modify paragraph 1; there are now _four_ forms of `$template-argument$`.

::: std
[1]{.pnum} There are [three]{.rm} [four]{.addu} forms of `$template-argument$`, [three of which]{.addu} correspond[ing]{.rm} to the three forms of `$template-parameter$`: type, non-type and template.

::: std
[9]{.pnum} When a `$simple-template-id$` [or `$splice-specialization-specifier$`]{.addu} does not [name]{.rm} [designate]{.addu} a function, a default `$template-argument$` is implicitly instantiated when the value of that default argument is needed.

:::

### [temp.arg.type]{.sref} Template type arguments {-}

Extend [temp.arg.type]{.sref}/1 to cover splice template arguments:

::: std
[1]{.pnum} A `$template-argument$` for a `$template-parameter$` which is a type shall [either]{.addu} be a `$type-id$` [or a `$splice-template-argument$` whose `$splice-specifier$` designates a type]{.addu}.
:::

### [temp.arg.nontype]{.sref} Template non-type arguments {-}

[We don't think we have to change anything here, since if `E` is a `$splice-specifier$` that can be interpreted as a `$splice-expression$`, the requirements already fall out based on how paragraphs 1 and 3 are already worded]{.draftnote}

::: std
[1]{.pnum} If the type `T` of a *template-parameter* ([temp.param]) contains a placeholder type ([dcl.spec.auto]) or a placeholder for a deduced class type ([dcl.type.class.deduct]), the type of the parameter is the type deduced for the variable x in the invented
declaration
```cpp
T x = $E$ ;
```
where `$E$` is the template argument provided for the parameter.

[2]{.pnum} The value of a non-type *template-parameter* `P` of (possibly deduced) type `T` [...]

[3]{.pnum} Otherwise, a temporary variable
```cpp
constexpr T v = $A$;
```
is introduced.
:::

### [temp.arg.template]{.sref} Template template arguments {-}

Extend [temp.arg.template]{.sref}/1 to cover splice template arguments:

::: std
[1]{.pnum} A `$template-argument$` for a template `$template-parameter$` shall be [the name of]{.rm} a class template or an alias template, expressed as [an]{.addu} `$id-expression$` [or a `$splice-template-argument$`]{.addu}. Only primary templates are considered when matching the template argument with the corresponding parameter; partial specializations are not considered even if their parameter lists match that of the template template parameter.
:::

### [temp.constr.normal]{.sref} Constraint normalization {-}

Include a reference to `$splice-expression$`s in Note 1.

::: std
[Normalization of `$constraint-expression$`s is performed when determining the associated constraints ([temp.constr.constr]) of a declaration and when evaluating the value of an `$id-expression$` [or `$splice-expression$`]{.addu} that names a concept specialization ([expr.prim.id] [, [expr.prim.splice]]{.addu})]{.note1}

### [temp.type]{.sref} Type equivalence {-}

Extend paragraph 1 to also define the "sameness" of `$splice-specialization-specifier$`s:

::: std
[1]{.pnum} Two `$template-id$`s [or `$splice-specialization-specifier$`s]{.addu} are the same if

* [#.#]{.pnum} their `$template-name$`s, `$operator-function-id$`s, [or]{.rm} `$literal-operator-id$`s[, or `$splice-specifier$`s]{.addu} refer to the same template, and

* [#.#]{.pnum} the template parameter values determined by their corresponding non-type template arguments ([temp.arg.nontype]{.sref}) are template-argument-equivalent (see below), and
* [#.#]{.pnum} their corresponding template `$template-argument$`s refer to the same template.

Two `$template-id$`s [or `$splice-specialization-specifier$`s]{.addu} that are the same refer to the same class, function, or variable.

:::

Extend *template-argument-equivalent* in paragraph 2 to handle `std::meta::info`:

[2]{.pnum} Two values are *template-argument-equivalent* if they are of the same type and

:::

### [temp.deduct.guide]{.sref} Deduction guides {-}

Extend paragraph 1 to clarify that `$splice-type-specifier$`s can also leverage deduction guides.

::: std
[1]{.pnum} Deduction guides are used when a `$template-name$` [or `$splice-type-specifier$`]{.addu} appears as a type specifier for a deduced class type ([dcl.type.class.deduct]{.sref}). Deduction guides are not found by name lookup. Instead, when performing class template argument deduction ([over.match.class.deduct]{.sref}), all reachable deduction guides declared for the class template are considered.

:::

### [temp.mem]{.sref} Member templates {-}

Clarify in Note 1 that a specialization of a conversion function template can be formed through a `$splice-expression$`.

::: std
::: note
A specialization of a conversion function template is referenced in the same way as a non-template conversion function that converts to the same type ([class.conv.fct]{.sref}).

...

[An expression designating a particular specialization of a conversion function template can only be formed with a `$splice-expression$`.]{.addu} There is no [analogous]{.addu} syntax to form a `$template-id$` ([temp.names]{.sref}) [for such a function]{.addu} by providing an explicit template argument list ([temp.arg.explicit]{.sref}).

### [temp.alias]{.sref} Alias templates {-}

Extend paragraph 2 to enable reflection of alias template specializations.

::: std
[2]{.pnum} [When a]{.rm} [A]{.addu} `$template-id$` [that]{.addu} refers to the specialization of an alias template[, it is equivalent to]{.rm} [is a `$typedef-name$` for a type alias whose underlying entity is]{.addu} the associated type obtained by substitution of its `$template-arguments$` for the `$template-parameters$` in the `$defining-type-id$` of the alias template.

### [temp.res.general]{.sref} General {-}

Extend paragraph 4 to define what it means for a `$splice-specifier$` to appear in a type-only context. Also `$using-enum-declarator$`s to the list of type-only contexts, as it allows the `typename` to be elided from a `$splice-type-specifier$` in non-dependent contexts.

[7]{.pnum} An initializer is dependent if any constituent expression ([intro.execution]{.sref}) of the initializer is type-dependent.

**Dependent splice specifiers   [temp.dep.splice]**

[1]{.pnum} A `$splice-specifier$` is dependent if its converted `$constant-expression$` is value-dependent. A `$splice-specialization-specifier$` or `$splice-scope-specifier$` is dependent if its `$splice-template-argument$` is dependent.

### [temp.deduct.call]{.sref} Deducing template arguments from a function call {-}

Modify paragraph 4.3 to treat parameter types of function templates that are specified using `$splice-specialization-specifier$`s the same as parameter types that are specified using `$simple-template-id$`s.

[1]{.pnum} Each function, and each instantiation of each function template, specified in this header is a designated addressable function ([namespace.std]).

[2]{.pnum} The behavior of any function specified in namespace `std::meta` is implementation-defined when a reflection of a construct not otherwise specified by this document is provided as an argument.

[Values of type `std::meta::info` may represent implementation-defined constructs ([basic.fundamental]{.sref}).]{.note}

::: note
 The behavior of many of the functions specified in namespace `std::meta` have semantics that would be affected by the completeness of class types represented by reflection arguments ([temp.inst]). For such functions, for any reflection `r` such that `dealias(r)` represents a specialization of a templated class with a reachable definition, the specialization is implicitly instantiated.

::: example
```cpp
template <class T>
struct X {
  T mem;
};

static_assert(size_of(^^X<int>) == sizeof(int)); // instantiates X<int>
```
:::
:::

[3]{.pnum} Any function in namespace `std::meta` that whose return type is `string_view` or `u8string_view` returns an object `$V$` such that `$V$.data()[$V$.size()] == '\0'`.

::: example
```cpp
struct C { };

constexpr string_view sv = identifier_of(^^C);
static_assert(sv == "C");
static_assert(sv.data()[0] == 'C');
static_assert(sv.data()[1] == '\0');

for every `@$r$~$k$~@` in `mdescrs`.

[#]{.pnum} *Effects*:
Produces an injected declaration `$D$` ([expr.const]) that provides a definition for `$C$` with properties as follows:

- [#.1]{.pnum} The target scope of `$D$` is the scope to which `$C$` belongs ([basic.scope.scope]).
- [#.#]{.pnum} The locus of `$D$` follows immediately after the manifestly constant-evaluated expression currently under evaluation.
- [#.#]{.pnum} If `$C$` is a specialization of a class template `$T$`, then `$D$` is is an explicit specialization of `$T$`.
- [#.#]{.pnum} `$D$` contains a public non-static data member or unnamed bit-field corresponding to each reflection value `@$r$~$K$~@` in `mdescrs`. For every other `@$r$~$L$~@` in `mdescrs` such that `$K$ < $L$`, the declaration of `@$r$~$K$~@` precedes the declaration of `@$r$~$L$~@`.
- [#.#]{.pnum} A non-static data member or unnamed bit-field corresponding to each `@$r$~$K$~@` is declared with the type or type alias represented by `@$t$~$K$~@`.
- [#.#]{.pnum} A non-static data member corresponding to a reflection `@$r$~$K$~@` for which `@$o$~$K$~@.no_unique_address` is `true` is declared with the attribute `[[no_unique_address]]`.
- [#.#]{.pnum} A non-static data member or unnamed bit-field corresponding to a reflection `@$r$~$K$~@` for which `@$o$~$K$~@.bit_width` contains a value is declared as a bit-field whose width is that value.
- [#.#]{.pnum} A non-static data member corresponding to a reflection `@$r$~$K$~@` for which `@$o$~$K$~@.alignment` contains a value is declared with the `$alignment-specifier$` `alignas(@$o$~$K$~@.alignment)`.
- [#.#]{.pnum} A non-static data member or unnamed bit-field corresponding to a reflection `@$r$~$K$~@` is declared with a name determined as follows:
  - If `@$o$~$K$~@.name` does not contain a value, an unnamed bit-field is declared.
  - Otherwise, the name of the non-static data member is the identifier determined by the character sequence encoded by `u8identifier_of(@$r$~$K$~@)` in UTF-8.
- [#.#]{.pnum} If `$C$` is a union type for which any of its members are not trivially default constructible, then `$D$` has a user-provided default constructor which has no effect.
- [#.#]{.pnum} If `$C$` is a union type for which any of its members are not trivially destructible, then `$D$` has a user-provided destructor which has no effect.

This is a feature with both a language and library component. Our usual practice is to provide something like `__cpp_impl_reflection` and `__cpp_lib_reflection` for this. But since the two pieces are so closely tied together, maybe it really only makes sense to provide one?

For now, we'll add both.
